      "I wanted to upgrade our 12- and 17-year-old TV's and have been researching all the options.  I used rtingsdotcom to compare performance, as well as online reviews, and it wasn't easy.  It seemed that unless you were spending big bucks, rtings always had issues.In the end, I went for the 65\" Vizio M65Q7-JO1 for the main TV.  The ratings were pretty good and the value seemed good at $699 with an OEM 3-year warranty from my local membership warehouse.  So, far I've been very pleased with it.This TV also allowed me to have a reference point for the rtings reviews.  Knowing what they said about the Vizio compared with what I saw, I was able to use that to gauge other TV's against my needs..These first gen Fire TV's aren't rated at all highly. However, when the 43 inch Fire TV was on sale for $259 with a free Echo Dot, I decided it was worth trying.  The smaller TV is used almost exclusively by my wife to watch Food Network and HGTV (!) from a distance of about 13 ft.  She doesn't care about smart features and sits almost square on to the TV, slightly down and to the right in a brightly (daylight) illuminated 'sunroom', just off the kitchen..After unpacking the Fire TV, I immediately mounted it on a stand.  (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 37-55 inch LCD LED TVs).  The included Fire TV feet would be too wide for the cabinet's shelf.  The required mounting screws were already in the VESA mounting points, which was great!  No searching around for the right thread and length screws..On powering up the TV, Amazon had it all set up with my Wi-Fi password and Amazon account. Somewhat scary, but understandable, given that we have Echo Dots all around the house.  So it automatically updated the firm- and soft-ware and was ready to go!  The screen was looking good with no defects.  Interestingly, the TV comes with just a short, get-up-and-run pamphlet, with no manual.  I searched online and found a pdf, though, being an engineer, I was able to just go through the menus and quickly understand the systems.  Other's might struggle.  Vizio actually has the manual built into the TV's menu..We use Chromecast with Google TV and stream YoutubeTV on both TV's, as well as my daughter's TV, while she's at college.  I didn't even bother to check out the Fire TV apps and immediately installed the Chromecast.I had trouble with the Chromecast remote.  Google doesn't list 'Amazon' or 'Fire TV' as options for the remote codes.  I knew from research that the Fire TV is a TCL rebrand and tried that remote code offering.  It sort of worked but wasn't good enough.  The volume was slow to respond, unless right up close to the TV.  The power worked but didn't work to turn on the Chromecast once it had turned itself off.  The input selection was also problematic.  After much trial and error, I got the Chromecast remote working correctly using the settings shown in the photo.I also found that I could connect the Fire TV remote to the Chromecast.  There's a video on YT on that.  The Fire TV remote connects via BT to the Chromecast by long pressing the HOME button to go into pairing mode.  You do have to hold the remote right next to the Chromecast itself to get it to connect to the Fire TV remote.  It'll come up as 'AR'. Once connected it works perfectly but has to be disconnected to do anything with the TV settings.  In the end, I just disconnected it and use the Google remote..I have found that my old TV's had much better reflection handling.  Any reflections were very muted.  The modern TV's all seem to be more reflective.  The Fire TV is a little worse than the Vizio.  You can see that in the photo. Fortunately, where my wife sits, the windows are out of view on the TV screen and it's only with a black screen that the reflections are an issue.  On the Vizio, I keep the curtains drawn over the window directly behind me..Brightness is as rtings said; not that bright.  I found the best picture setting was DYNAMIC, with Cinema mode, Noise Reduction and Dynamic backlight OFF and standard white balance.  This gives the brightest picture and the nicest color saturation.  The TV works well in the room during the day.  The Cinema mode resulted in a noticeable Soap Opera effect, which I don't like.The display panel washes out very quickly as you view it off-center.  At 40 degrees to the screen, the colors are not at all good and faces start to look a little gray.  The Vizio is similar, but not as bad.  Both are best viewed from directly in front..With 4K content, the picture quality is actually pretty good.  I have no complaints.  However, really close up, you can see artifacts and a white ghosting around objects.  This is especially noticeable on non-4K content, where the close-up image also seems out of focus, with lots of artifacts.  However, from a 6ft distance, the image isn't bad.I watched some old 1980's Bergerac episodes and the picture quality was quite acceptable with my picture settings.I do see that news text on the screen is not as well defined as on the Vizio.  In the photos, you can see the Fire TV letters' edges are rougher and less defined on the Fire TV compared with the albeit a larger and Quantum dot Vizio.CONCLUSION:If you are on a tight budget, I think the Amazon Fire TV is a viable option, but I certainly don't recommend you buy it above $280.  There are likely better options out there for a few dollars more.\n",

      "I tend to enjoy the newest Tech as it comes out.  I have spent too much really on TV's in the past I have owned LG, Sony, Samsung and a few other brands and all have done their jobs respectably.I purchased THIS TV to take advantage that the Xbox Series X 4k options have and I have been very shocked.  I did not expect to get so much with what many would not say is the highest end of TV's.  The setup was simpler than any I have had so far it literally guided me to the settings and it has been very easy to get up and running with all the apps and speakers etc.  The only thing it does not do is have a 120 FPS setting for gaming but that is fine 4k 60 fps is doing very well for gaming purposes right now and for the price it is not worth the extra money for a few more frames per second for a console.  For a monitor and pc a bit different but in this case it works wonderfully.  Now on to the picture and what a picture it is.  I can see the finest details and the darks are darks and the lighting is perfect.  I am using the HDR feature and it looks amazing on a TV.  HDR on a pc does not always look the best for me but on this TV is great no more having to fiddle with brightness and contrast to get the desired look, HDR has needed no tuning for my preference.  So if you are looking for a 4k Smart TV this is a great deal in all ways.  Unless you are reviewing movies or doing something that requires a higher frame rate this TV has been everything I could ask for and more, it simply is the best I have bought in many years.  I am impressed.\n",

      "Tv works great when you first get it. Easy to set up, difficult to maintain. Remote failed after 2 months and alexa still doesnt work. I paid for convienience and having to repair the remote it came with just to turn the tv on or off (there is no other way) is a huge problem. After troubleshooting a device only 2 months of use and things are failing, my next tv will not be a firetv due to the frustration of constantly having to reset it up. My alexa button doesnt work and there are no clear instructions how to fix it but a factory reset. Very well maintained home, this product seems just designed to fail.UPDATE**  (9/7/2022) A customer outreach rep. Actually called me today about my review. They never asked any personal information and never will, just for you to verify the information they have is correct. This is awesome customer service. The call came from an unknown number from Washington D.C. (200 area code). They tried to help troubleshoot the issue with the remote, agreed it was defective, and immediately sent out a replacement at no charge. My review upgraded due to the fact i felt as Amazon wanted me to be satisfied with my purchase. Review will be updated upon arrival with a completely working remote.UPDATE** replacement remote arrived in refurbished condition. The remote worked without having to set it up with the exception of the Alexa button again. Although, when i went into the pair settings, this remote connected right away. I was instructed to dispose of the old remote properly from Amazon outreach team. I saved it for a back up.Customer serveice was beyond expectations and unexpected. Review changed to 5 stars.\n",

      "Wanted to replace the 43 inch TV in bedroom, as the viewing distance is longer and makes the smaller TV not as enjoyable. With the narrow border, this 55 fits where I felt I might need to stop at a 50 incher.I immediately hated it and was ready to put back in the box and ship it back, but just took some setup and resetting as mentioned below. Seems like a keeper.Well packaged (my older ones didn't come with a thick cardboard piece protecting the screen front, this one did, might be standard now).Pulled old TV off the wall and removed the mount. Had to reuse the VESA mount screws as none are provided in the new TV. With it being much larger than old one, it weighs about half. Power and video connectors are on opposite sides, so had to do a little rewiring.Once up on the wall and all plugged in, the fun begins. At least 30 minutes of updates once connected to WiFi. However remote is only about 20% functional, even after it got a 3 minute update. Find out how to re-initialize remote to TV, and it works better but TV doesn't think there is a remote. eventually after doing it a few times it sees the remote, and all buttons function.Picture quality for HDMI input was very bad, and trying to change setup with remote not functioning was a trial. Once remote worked, I could go into setup and select Movie (auto was very bright, lots of compression artifacts) and it looks great.This TV (I know, it is a FireTV) is very app/streaming centric, but once I found the setting to default to last input, and that is 99% of the time HDMI1, then it behaves like I want, turn on and display my input, not the apps home screen where I have to use the TVs remote to clear it and show input in HDMI1. I mainly use the remote for my satellite service, and rarely use the TV one, but since it is also the streaming apps, I will use it, and it adds yet another Alexa mic to do things from, TV related or not.TV can be slow sometimes to turn on (it turns on reasonably, but doesn't show what is on the input for a while), again thought the remote was misbehaving again, it was just taking time to show anything.Sound is better than old TV, none of them are real great, I do have a sound bar but I can use this TV with out for watching news and normal shows (not action movies or things with lots of audio like music).I haven't tried casting to it (way easier to find stuff on a tablet with a keyboard then send it to the TV) and am getting my apps set back up, but the apps seem better than the FireTV stick, some of the video on Hulu stutters with it, not with the TV.\n",

      "Purchase:I purchased this TV based on the price and reviews as well as being part of the Amazon Fire family. I have had it set up for almost a week now and am enjoying it quite a bit.Responsiveness:My wife and I have used Amazon Fire TV devices for years now and it's nice not needing a stick or a cube to access the Fire interface. The menus are quick to load and responsive with content loading quickly and easily. (Note: this TV is used via ethernet connection in conjunction with 300Mbps download cable Internet).Packaging:Packaging was secure and kept the TV from damage in shipping. There was a small dent and tear in the box upon arrival but the 1 inch thick corrugated cardboard shield protecting the screen kept the TV from receiving any damage. The TV arrived within the 2 day Prime delivery time. The box was the store shelf box and was not a nondescript plain shipping box so anyone seeing the delivered TV would know what it was. Fortunately, my wife was at home to recieve the delivery so she asked the guy to place it in our garage for her.Setup:Setup was as easy as advertised. Connecting power and a few cables (ethernet, HDMI, HDMI eARC, etc.) and it was up and running. An update was downloaded and installed immediately and after a rapid automatic restart, the Amazon account setup opened on screen. Since we have an account, I just paired it to my account and selected to import all my account settings. Done and running.I mounted the TV to a raised stand bracket we used for our previous TV and was pleased all my existing harware worked for the new TV. The mounting holes on the back of the TV fit with the universal mounting bracket I already had and the harware worked flawlessly. Bonus!Sound:I paired this TV with an Amazon suggested soundbar (Sony HTS100F 2.0ch) and was delighted with how easily they paired up and that the Amazon Fire remote controlled the soundbar immediately without any code cycling or other shenanigans. In fact, I didn't even bother to put the batteries in the Sound soundbar remote.Picture:Going from a 10 year old LCD 1080p TV to a 4K TV was a vast improvment in picture. I pulled up Disney+ and started Book of Boba Fett to see how it displayed the dark scenes in that first episode. After messing with the brightness and backlight settings a bit I had a picture I was extremely happy with. I checked the show info and saw I was watching in 2160p and marveled at the difference between my previous 1080p experience. With a 2TB data cap though, we'll have to watch our 4K streaming consumption.Connections:This TV has 3 dedicated HDMI ports and an HDMI eARC port. It has ethernet, USB, optical audio, etc.) I also use this TV with a home theater PC connected via HDMI and was delighted with the resolution upgrade while using the TV as a PC monitor.A few snags:1. On day 2 I was unable to get the TV to respond to the remote to turn on. I used the physical power button in the bottom middle of the TV to start it manually and the remote functioned fine after that. Since that, the remote has functioned flawlessly to turn on the TV. I have no idea what caused the initial issue.2. I left the TV set to HDMI 1 (HTPC) when I shut it one night and the next day when I powered on the TV, the screen was flickering white noise and wouldn't bring up my Windows home screen. I used the home button on the remote to get back to Amazon's Fire interface and then switch back to HDMI 1 (HTPC) and had no issue with the picture. I have not been able to repeat this issue so am unsure what may have casued it.Thoughts:Despite a few odd snags, I have been extremely pleased with my experience with this TV so far. I belive the manufacturer is TCL and is considered a lower tier manufacturer but I haven't noticed any inferior features or quality in picture or sound. A wonderful experience on the whole. The two snags were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I would say this is more like a 4 3/4 star review.\n",

      "I was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, \"how much did you pay for this again?\" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don't understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations.  So glad I got it!\n",

      "We hunted for a tv for months, but didn't want a smart tv.  Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43\" was the perfect size for our room).We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, \"no, no, okay.\" Manual only; we didn't want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don't know why anyone complained it couldn't go loud enough.  The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of \"action/motion smoothness\" but didn't really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the  box.A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy!  Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy.  Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected.  When  you figure in the price, it's really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn't even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound.  1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven't tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven't tried it.) We're really happyas is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.\n",

      "The picture quality is stunning. You can literally see the actor's pores and wrinkles.  The sound quality is great. The product itself is standard. Looks great, feels great. Nothing about it feels cheap or looks cheap. For $259 this 50\" TV was a steal. I'd totally recommend it. If you're not tech savvy, this might not be for you. I'll talk about it later.Physically setting up the TV was super quick and straight-forward. As for the actual user experience/software, set up was also straight-forward and simple.I will say that the FireTv interface is very spammy. There's a few sponsored banners on the home page. A lot of the recommendations are for Prime Video -- which I have -- but a lot of them aren't free with Prime. They're recommending me content that I have to buy /rent -- which makes it feel like I'm being advertised to. Amazon's self-promotion seems to be a common theme in their Fire lineup that just ruins the user experience.  If this TV is for an older person, I'd worry that they would accidentally buy these movies and shows.Luckily for me, I have an XFinity Flex box. If you can get your hands on a Roku, that's even better. (I don't recommend Google Chromecast). Simply plug your streaming device into the HDMI port. Now you have a cleaner interface plus a nice TV picture quality.If you plan to use a streaming device instead of the FireTv interface, you have to alter your settings. Otherwise, everytime you power on your tv, it will go to the FireTv interface by default. Simply go to Settings > Display & Sounds > Power Controls > Power On >Last Input. Now, it will go to your streaming device on Power On.All that said, do you really need to use a Roku or another streaming device? No. It's really easy to access HBO MAX, Netflix, or Disney+. It's easy to access your installed apps. If you don't care about aesthetics, you'll be fine. The home page is just busy, spammy, and overwhelming. If you can handle that, no streaming stick required.Also, for people with Spectrum Tv, FireTv doesn't support a spectrum app. If that's a deal breaker, dont get it.Also, if want to get the FireTv today, you can get it at Best Buy. Best Buy will price match Amazon products (sold by Amazon; prices set by third party sellers aren't eligible for price match).Overall, I do recommend this TV. At its price point, it's a steal. If I had a reason to, I'd totally get more. Though next time, I'd probably aim for a bigger size.\n",

      "So far I have had this TV for about four days, ordered it on Prime Day and received it about the next Friday after and I got this delivered to me during the early morning hours. Usually Amazon Prime delivers during the afternoon around my area so when I got a notification that morning that it was already delivered at six am surprised me as I found it sitting in front of the doorstep. So it was delivered early as it was suppose to be delivered on Saturday but I got it a day earlier. Overall, setting this up was pretty simple, I booted it up and apparently it needed to update right out of the box so I let it update which took about an hour but shortly after that getting all the apps that I use onto the TV was pretty simple as well. The picture quality on the TV is pretty good, I think a soundbar isn't really needed as the sound the TV provides is pretty good as well.I have a PS5 and so gaming on this TV is pretty cool. It even switches to a gaming type mode of picture quality when you switch to the HDMI that has your PS5 Connected to which is unique because on my PlayStation 5 when I used on that TV it didn't do that at all and I would have to manually do it from the TV but with the Amazon Fire TV I didn't have to configure anything at all as it switched to that kind of pictured mode. My only problem, which it can be the TV itself or the HDMI Cable I have connected to the Cable Box is that at times it would flicker for a second and then stop, but do it again after awhile. When I'm always gaming, this is never an issue though so it could just be the HDMI Cable that could use a replacement. Overall, I am pretty much glad I got this at such an amazing price and maybe I'll use this TV for a good while.\n",

      "I took advantage of prime day and bought the 55\" version of this TV.  I was replacing a 37\" on the wall.  The installation was easy, and when first starting up (I associated it with my amazon account when purchasing) it auto-updated a couple of times and kept restarting to do it, but after about 15 minutes was up and ready to go.  I played with some of the built in apps and guide and they are pretty cool and work well.  I tried airplay from both my iphone and Mac and it works great -- just like an apple TV.  I use Tivo, and to get the Tivo remote to work with this TV, I had to use \"Element\" as the brand (so to those reviews where they said the TV is not in the list of other products, use \"Element.\"  One review complained that the TV always started on the homescreen when turned on, and not the video input they want (HDMI1)  You can set it the way you want, but you have to go into settings, picture, power-on options and you can choose home or use last video input used.  This way it stays on the cable box etc.  The Alexa feature is cool and works, but I really don't use it.  One of the reviews complained about not using standard screw sizes for wall mount.. This is not valid.. I ran into a similar issue as I was going from a 37\" to a 55\" and the screw sizes for these size sets are different where one uses M4 vs M6 screws...  Any wall mount kit will have the correct size screws included with it, and even if you are replacing an older smaller set like me and have lost the rest of the screws, I went to home depot and they sell them there as M6 in various lengths...  TV has only been installed and working 24 hours, but so far well worth the money!\n",

      "I wanted to upgrade our 12- and 17-year-old TV's and have been researching all the options.  I used rtingsdotcom to compare performance, as well as online reviews, and it wasn't easy.  It seemed that unless you were spending big bucks, rtings always had issues.In the end, I went for the 65\" Vizio M65Q7-JO1 for the main TV.  The ratings were pretty good and the value seemed good at $699 with an OEM 3-year warranty from my local membership warehouse.  So, far I've been very pleased with it.This TV also allowed me to have a reference point for the rtings reviews.  Knowing what they said about the Vizio compared with what I saw, I was able to use that to gauge other TV's against my needs..These first gen Fire TV's aren't rated at all highly. However, when the 43 inch Fire TV was on sale for $259 with a free Echo Dot, I decided it was worth trying.  The smaller TV is used almost exclusively by my wife to watch Food Network and HGTV (!) from a distance of about 13 ft.  She doesn't care about smart features and sits almost square on to the TV, slightly down and to the right in a brightly (daylight) illuminated 'sunroom', just off the kitchen..After unpacking the Fire TV, I immediately mounted it on a stand.  (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 37-55 inch LCD LED TVs).  The included Fire TV feet would be too wide for the cabinet's shelf.  The required mounting screws were already in the VESA mounting points, which was great!  No searching around for the right thread and length screws..On powering up the TV, Amazon had it all set up with my Wi-Fi password and Amazon account. Somewhat scary, but understandable, given that we have Echo Dots all around the house.  So it automatically updated the firm- and soft-ware and was ready to go!  The screen was looking good with no defects.  Interestingly, the TV comes with just a short, get-up-and-run pamphlet, with no manual.  I searched online and found a pdf, though, being an engineer, I was able to just go through the menus and quickly understand the systems.  Other's might struggle.  Vizio actually has the manual built into the TV's menu..We use Chromecast with Google TV and stream YoutubeTV on both TV's, as well as my daughter's TV, while she's at college.  I didn't even bother to check out the Fire TV apps and immediately installed the Chromecast.I had trouble with the Chromecast remote.  Google doesn't list 'Amazon' or 'Fire TV' as options for the remote codes.  I knew from research that the Fire TV is a TCL rebrand and tried that remote code offering.  It sort of worked but wasn't good enough.  The volume was slow to respond, unless right up close to the TV.  The power worked but didn't work to turn on the Chromecast once it had turned itself off.  The input selection was also problematic.  After much trial and error, I got the Chromecast remote working correctly using the settings shown in the photo.I also found that I could connect the Fire TV remote to the Chromecast.  There's a video on YT on that.  The Fire TV remote connects via BT to the Chromecast by long pressing the HOME button to go into pairing mode.  You do have to hold the remote right next to the Chromecast itself to get it to connect to the Fire TV remote.  It'll come up as 'AR'. Once connected it works perfectly but has to be disconnected to do anything with the TV settings.  In the end, I just disconnected it and use the Google remote..I have found that my old TV's had much better reflection handling.  Any reflections were very muted.  The modern TV's all seem to be more reflective.  The Fire TV is a little worse than the Vizio.  You can see that in the photo. Fortunately, where my wife sits, the windows are out of view on the TV screen and it's only with a black screen that the reflections are an issue.  On the Vizio, I keep the curtains drawn over the window directly behind me..Brightness is as rtings said; not that bright.  I found the best picture setting was DYNAMIC, with Cinema mode, Noise Reduction and Dynamic backlight OFF and standard white balance.  This gives the brightest picture and the nicest color saturation.  The TV works well in the room during the day.  The Cinema mode resulted in a noticeable Soap Opera effect, which I don't like.The display panel washes out very quickly as you view it off-center.  At 40 degrees to the screen, the colors are not at all good and faces start to look a little gray.  The Vizio is similar, but not as bad.  Both are best viewed from directly in front..With 4K content, the picture quality is actually pretty good.  I have no complaints.  However, really close up, you can see artifacts and a white ghosting around objects.  This is especially noticeable on non-4K content, where the close-up image also seems out of focus, with lots of artifacts.  However, from a 6ft distance, the image isn't bad.I watched some old 1980's Bergerac episodes and the picture quality was quite acceptable with my picture settings.I do see that news text on the screen is not as well defined as on the Vizio.  In the photos, you can see the Fire TV letters' edges are rougher and less defined on the Fire TV compared with the albeit a larger and Quantum dot Vizio.CONCLUSION:If you are on a tight budget, I think the Amazon Fire TV is a viable option, but I certainly don't recommend you buy it above $280.  There are likely better options out there for a few dollars more.\n",

      "I tend to enjoy the newest Tech as it comes out.  I have spent too much really on TV's in the past I have owned LG, Sony, Samsung and a few other brands and all have done their jobs respectably.I purchased THIS TV to take advantage that the Xbox Series X 4k options have and I have been very shocked.  I did not expect to get so much with what many would not say is the highest end of TV's.  The setup was simpler than any I have had so far it literally guided me to the settings and it has been very easy to get up and running with all the apps and speakers etc.  The only thing it does not do is have a 120 FPS setting for gaming but that is fine 4k 60 fps is doing very well for gaming purposes right now and for the price it is not worth the extra money for a few more frames per second for a console.  For a monitor and pc a bit different but in this case it works wonderfully.  Now on to the picture and what a picture it is.  I can see the finest details and the darks are darks and the lighting is perfect.  I am using the HDR feature and it looks amazing on a TV.  HDR on a pc does not always look the best for me but on this TV is great no more having to fiddle with brightness and contrast to get the desired look, HDR has needed no tuning for my preference.  So if you are looking for a 4k Smart TV this is a great deal in all ways.  Unless you are reviewing movies or doing something that requires a higher frame rate this TV has been everything I could ask for and more, it simply is the best I have bought in many years.  I am impressed.\n",

      "Tv works great when you first get it. Easy to set up, difficult to maintain. Remote failed after 2 months and alexa still doesnt work. I paid for convienience and having to repair the remote it came with just to turn the tv on or off (there is no other way) is a huge problem. After troubleshooting a device only 2 months of use and things are failing, my next tv will not be a firetv due to the frustration of constantly having to reset it up. My alexa button doesnt work and there are no clear instructions how to fix it but a factory reset. Very well maintained home, this product seems just designed to fail.UPDATE**  (9/7/2022) A customer outreach rep. Actually called me today about my review. They never asked any personal information and never will, just for you to verify the information they have is correct. This is awesome customer service. The call came from an unknown number from Washington D.C. (200 area code). They tried to help troubleshoot the issue with the remote, agreed it was defective, and immediately sent out a replacement at no charge. My review upgraded due to the fact i felt as Amazon wanted me to be satisfied with my purchase. Review will be updated upon arrival with a completely working remote.UPDATE** replacement remote arrived in refurbished condition. The remote worked without having to set it up with the exception of the Alexa button again. Although, when i went into the pair settings, this remote connected right away. I was instructed to dispose of the old remote properly from Amazon outreach team. I saved it for a back up.Customer serveice was beyond expectations and unexpected. Review changed to 5 stars.\n",

      "Wanted to replace the 43 inch TV in bedroom, as the viewing distance is longer and makes the smaller TV not as enjoyable. With the narrow border, this 55 fits where I felt I might need to stop at a 50 incher.I immediately hated it and was ready to put back in the box and ship it back, but just took some setup and resetting as mentioned below. Seems like a keeper.Well packaged (my older ones didn't come with a thick cardboard piece protecting the screen front, this one did, might be standard now).Pulled old TV off the wall and removed the mount. Had to reuse the VESA mount screws as none are provided in the new TV. With it being much larger than old one, it weighs about half. Power and video connectors are on opposite sides, so had to do a little rewiring.Once up on the wall and all plugged in, the fun begins. At least 30 minutes of updates once connected to WiFi. However remote is only about 20% functional, even after it got a 3 minute update. Find out how to re-initialize remote to TV, and it works better but TV doesn't think there is a remote. eventually after doing it a few times it sees the remote, and all buttons function.Picture quality for HDMI input was very bad, and trying to change setup with remote not functioning was a trial. Once remote worked, I could go into setup and select Movie (auto was very bright, lots of compression artifacts) and it looks great.This TV (I know, it is a FireTV) is very app/streaming centric, but once I found the setting to default to last input, and that is 99% of the time HDMI1, then it behaves like I want, turn on and display my input, not the apps home screen where I have to use the TVs remote to clear it and show input in HDMI1. I mainly use the remote for my satellite service, and rarely use the TV one, but since it is also the streaming apps, I will use it, and it adds yet another Alexa mic to do things from, TV related or not.TV can be slow sometimes to turn on (it turns on reasonably, but doesn't show what is on the input for a while), again thought the remote was misbehaving again, it was just taking time to show anything.Sound is better than old TV, none of them are real great, I do have a sound bar but I can use this TV with out for watching news and normal shows (not action movies or things with lots of audio like music).I haven't tried casting to it (way easier to find stuff on a tablet with a keyboard then send it to the TV) and am getting my apps set back up, but the apps seem better than the FireTV stick, some of the video on Hulu stutters with it, not with the TV.\n",

      "Purchase:I purchased this TV based on the price and reviews as well as being part of the Amazon Fire family. I have had it set up for almost a week now and am enjoying it quite a bit.Responsiveness:My wife and I have used Amazon Fire TV devices for years now and it's nice not needing a stick or a cube to access the Fire interface. The menus are quick to load and responsive with content loading quickly and easily. (Note: this TV is used via ethernet connection in conjunction with 300Mbps download cable Internet).Packaging:Packaging was secure and kept the TV from damage in shipping. There was a small dent and tear in the box upon arrival but the 1 inch thick corrugated cardboard shield protecting the screen kept the TV from receiving any damage. The TV arrived within the 2 day Prime delivery time. The box was the store shelf box and was not a nondescript plain shipping box so anyone seeing the delivered TV would know what it was. Fortunately, my wife was at home to recieve the delivery so she asked the guy to place it in our garage for her.Setup:Setup was as easy as advertised. Connecting power and a few cables (ethernet, HDMI, HDMI eARC, etc.) and it was up and running. An update was downloaded and installed immediately and after a rapid automatic restart, the Amazon account setup opened on screen. Since we have an account, I just paired it to my account and selected to import all my account settings. Done and running.I mounted the TV to a raised stand bracket we used for our previous TV and was pleased all my existing harware worked for the new TV. The mounting holes on the back of the TV fit with the universal mounting bracket I already had and the harware worked flawlessly. Bonus!Sound:I paired this TV with an Amazon suggested soundbar (Sony HTS100F 2.0ch) and was delighted with how easily they paired up and that the Amazon Fire remote controlled the soundbar immediately without any code cycling or other shenanigans. In fact, I didn't even bother to put the batteries in the Sound soundbar remote.Picture:Going from a 10 year old LCD 1080p TV to a 4K TV was a vast improvment in picture. I pulled up Disney+ and started Book of Boba Fett to see how it displayed the dark scenes in that first episode. After messing with the brightness and backlight settings a bit I had a picture I was extremely happy with. I checked the show info and saw I was watching in 2160p and marveled at the difference between my previous 1080p experience. With a 2TB data cap though, we'll have to watch our 4K streaming consumption.Connections:This TV has 3 dedicated HDMI ports and an HDMI eARC port. It has ethernet, USB, optical audio, etc.) I also use this TV with a home theater PC connected via HDMI and was delighted with the resolution upgrade while using the TV as a PC monitor.A few snags:1. On day 2 I was unable to get the TV to respond to the remote to turn on. I used the physical power button in the bottom middle of the TV to start it manually and the remote functioned fine after that. Since that, the remote has functioned flawlessly to turn on the TV. I have no idea what caused the initial issue.2. I left the TV set to HDMI 1 (HTPC) when I shut it one night and the next day when I powered on the TV, the screen was flickering white noise and wouldn't bring up my Windows home screen. I used the home button on the remote to get back to Amazon's Fire interface and then switch back to HDMI 1 (HTPC) and had no issue with the picture. I have not been able to repeat this issue so am unsure what may have casued it.Thoughts:Despite a few odd snags, I have been extremely pleased with my experience with this TV so far. I belive the manufacturer is TCL and is considered a lower tier manufacturer but I haven't noticed any inferior features or quality in picture or sound. A wonderful experience on the whole. The two snags were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I would say this is more like a 4 3/4 star review.\n",

      "I was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, \"how much did you pay for this again?\" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don't understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations.  So glad I got it!\n",

      "We hunted for a tv for months, but didn't want a smart tv.  Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43\" was the perfect size for our room).We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, \"no, no, okay.\" Manual only; we didn't want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don't know why anyone complained it couldn't go loud enough.  The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of \"action/motion smoothness\" but didn't really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the  box.A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy!  Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy.  Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected.  When  you figure in the price, it's really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn't even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound.  1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven't tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven't tried it.) We're really happyas is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.\n",

      "The picture quality is stunning. You can literally see the actor's pores and wrinkles.  The sound quality is great. The product itself is standard. Looks great, feels great. Nothing about it feels cheap or looks cheap. For $259 this 50\" TV was a steal. I'd totally recommend it. If you're not tech savvy, this might not be for you. I'll talk about it later.Physically setting up the TV was super quick and straight-forward. As for the actual user experience/software, set up was also straight-forward and simple.I will say that the FireTv interface is very spammy. There's a few sponsored banners on the home page. A lot of the recommendations are for Prime Video -- which I have -- but a lot of them aren't free with Prime. They're recommending me content that I have to buy /rent -- which makes it feel like I'm being advertised to. Amazon's self-promotion seems to be a common theme in their Fire lineup that just ruins the user experience.  If this TV is for an older person, I'd worry that they would accidentally buy these movies and shows.Luckily for me, I have an XFinity Flex box. If you can get your hands on a Roku, that's even better. (I don't recommend Google Chromecast). Simply plug your streaming device into the HDMI port. Now you have a cleaner interface plus a nice TV picture quality.If you plan to use a streaming device instead of the FireTv interface, you have to alter your settings. Otherwise, everytime you power on your tv, it will go to the FireTv interface by default. Simply go to Settings > Display & Sounds > Power Controls > Power On >Last Input. Now, it will go to your streaming device on Power On.All that said, do you really need to use a Roku or another streaming device? No. It's really easy to access HBO MAX, Netflix, or Disney+. It's easy to access your installed apps. If you don't care about aesthetics, you'll be fine. The home page is just busy, spammy, and overwhelming. If you can handle that, no streaming stick required.Also, for people with Spectrum Tv, FireTv doesn't support a spectrum app. If that's a deal breaker, dont get it.Also, if want to get the FireTv today, you can get it at Best Buy. Best Buy will price match Amazon products (sold by Amazon; prices set by third party sellers aren't eligible for price match).Overall, I do recommend this TV. At its price point, it's a steal. If I had a reason to, I'd totally get more. Though next time, I'd probably aim for a bigger size.\n",

I gave the Fire TV OS a fair try, but I really just prefer the Chromecast with Google TV that I was using previously. The one thing I really liked about the Fire TV OS was the live TV guide. It gives all my OTA channels a nice guide just as if it were cable. Plus, it integrates all my streaming channels from lots of different sources. I think that is probably the only thing I will continue to use the Fire OS for.The speakers on this TV don't sound that great. They are passible, and they sound better than the ones on the TV in my bedroom. I would still highly recommend a sound bar. Fortunately, we already had a Vizio 3.1.2 sound bar. I was able to connect it to the TV with the HDMI eARC port and it works flawlessly.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone. It has great picture quality and some cool features for the money. Especially if you can purchase it for a discount like I did. Perhaps, if you must pay the full price, shop around and compare with some other options.\n",

      "Arrived quickly and was very easy to set up because I had a fire stick already it transferred all my apps and everything right to the TV. The sound is good and the picture is good. The smart features that I can use without Alexa are great. But I won't use Alexa or Siri or any of that so that's why the one star on the Alexa, because I don't use it! So the one star on that is not a reflection on the overall performance or quality of the tv. It's strictly because I will not use it. But I'm sure it's great and I'm sure lots of people love it! Glad I bought it it was a great deal!\n",

They tried to give us a refurbished unit, unbelievable.  Then on top of that they provided us UPS labels to ship it back but it was not pre-paid.

      "Got this tv for our bead room.  Replaced a 12 year old tv so anything would have been an upgrade.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the picture quality.  Sound was not that great so I got a cheap sound bar and it’s an awesome set up.  Not sure why some of the reviews say the picture quality is bad.  Blacks are black and no real halos around light objects with black background.  Oh and yes the little light does say on when the tv is in sleep mode.  But is is not bright at all.  Don’t believe the reviews that say it’s so bright they can sleep.  That’s just false.The one thing I don’t like is the tv does not power down.  It goes into sleep mode.  So if you want background LEDs the will NOT power off when the tv is shut off. That’s a bummer.  So if u still want the LEDs make sure you don’t lose the LED remote.\n",

      "First let me start off by saying that I purchased a table top tv stand as I feel more comfortable with that kind of set up opposed to the standard legs n smart tv's. It was easy to attach with the vesa holes and setting it all up was easy. The TV itself was easy for me to move around, attach the stand, etc., and I purchased the 50 inch model. The pictures clarity is amazing. My old tv was a 2009 Samsung and it's night and day. That's how much of an improvement the Amazon Fire TV is compared to an older name brand TV. I did purchase a sound bar and literally between the sound bar and the TV, I felt like I was watching a movie in a theater. I don't post reviews very often but the TV has impressed me. I do have cable hook up and may end that once my contract expires and the interface on the tv switching between cable or the smart tv options is the same as the fire stick I have on a smaller bedroom tv. Again, I was able to take out if the box, attach to a tv stand and place on a table with no assistance in probably less that 10 minutes. The 50 inch tv weighs around 25 lbs but it's not awkward to handle. Well worth your while to give the tv a try as opposed to more expensive name brand models.\n",

Fortunately, the second shipment was handled more carefully by USPS and was delivered by my regular mail carrier in perfect condition.

Save the trouble and buy a non Amazon brand tv and pay for better shipping  UPDATE:  After leaving my negative review a Amazon representative got into contact with me and informed me a update might be needed to get rid of this black flicker.  So I updated the tv and now there’s NO black flicker. Overall for being one of the cheapest 50’ 4K tvs on Amazon this thing is pretty good. Decent picture, at times the TV’s running so smooth it looks unnatural. Only giving it a 4/5 because it’s kinda hard to find the update section in the settings menu because there’s like 3 different settings menus lol.  Overall it’s a good tv and I’d recommend it to anyone if you want a cheap but a good quality 4K tv, just make sure the software up to date if you’re having any issues!\n",

      "We lived with a 32\" \"dumb\" TV for years, relying on other devices to provide streaming content. When we decided to upgrade, we found the Amazon Fire TV 50\" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV. The size is perfect for our family of 4, much larger than the old 32\" screen, but not something that overwhelms our space. The picture quality is remarkable, and we run at about 60% backlighting and the picture is still super bright and clear. The TV comes pre-installed with many streaming providers, and setup was a breeze. Many other providers are available for download. I saw a number of reviews that complained of the light when TV is powered down; either Amazon heard this complaint and changed the lighting, or folks are a lot more sensitive to light than we are. The remote is small, yet easy to use. I haven't set up any voice commands, but the remote allows for voice commands. When we first set the system up, once we got the TV connected to wifi, a few downloads took place, the TV integrated with our prime account, and we were up and running in about 15-20 minutes. Since then, not one problem. I don't know why we waited this long to upgrade our viewing experience!\n",

      "I'm happy and impressed with it.TV came well packaged and was easy to set up. Which is to be expected as Amazon is just slapping their FireTV OS guts and some branding on some TVs. But they still managed to get that Amazon feel across in the design and the accessories. I will say it would've been nice if they included an ethernet cable but I guess those saved pennies help their space program or something. Everything you need to get started is there with that minimalist Amazon appeal though. I was unpackaged, plugged in, and powered on in minutes.Set up was a breeze after waiting for an update to download and install. If you're familiar with any of the Fire TV Sticks or other Amazon devices, everything here is familiar. I'm neck deep in the Amazon environment from Recast to Fire Sticks so this was an easy choice to take a flyer on. And yes, Recast works on this TV. So to the dozens of us that use it, worry not. The new Fire remote is handy and adds the extra stuff you need for full control of a TV while still being simple. Settings, channel up and down, Live TV, etc. are all there. I'm not the biggest fan of branded app buttons at the bottom of the remote as things go away and get renamed, but the more buttons the merrier. I'm sure they can be rebound to other apps.The introductory price of the 50\" was too good to pass up. But I will say all the regular prices are just high enough to not be complete bargains. I imagine modest discounts will come occasionally and will be well worth considering. And to be fair, these aren't bare minimum or cheap TVs. You get some real bang for your buck. Above average picture quality and honestly the best \"smart\" integration I've seen in a TV. I know they added one \"premium\" feature of Dolby Vision to the two largest options of the OMNI series but I do wish they would've made a model with a few more bells and whistles. Especially ones geared towards \"gamers\" and their consoles. 120hz, VRR, stuff like that. Would've been a riskier business choice I suppose. I was shopping for a bedroom and 65\" or 75\" was just too big and DV wasn't enough of an allure. But for an introductory line of TVs I think they struck the right balance of options in the two lines and prices points. I'm not a hands free voice user, so I didn't mind choosing the more budget friendly 4-Series line. And again, the introductory price on the 50\" was a great deal. Borderline steal. I'm very satisfied.Back to the OS and its spectacular integration; It boots up quickly and is always one home button, button click away no matter what you're doing or which input you're on. Everything is snappy and loads quickly. Apple+, PS5, Prime Video, PLEX, Recast, etc. have all been tested and work/look great. There's enough picture options to dial things in to your liking. I liked that Dynamic Backlight was off, but disappointed that Action Smoothing was cranked. But that's me. You can adjust the picture settings for each input. AND for each individual app! Which is pretty amazing and useful. The TV did have input lag with the PS5 out of the box. One of the picture settings like MPEG filter or something was the culprit, but there is a dedicated \"game\" profile in the picture settings presets that solved everything. I could see this being a small oversight that leads to a couple unhappy experiences  (UPDATE: The TV received an update after launch that fixed this and it 'should' choose the \"game\" profile automatically now). All the options you need are there to solve things though. I can't wait to explore the nooks and crannies of this thing more. I definitely think they integrated the Fire OS directly to the TV really really well.Big thumbs up to Amazon on their first run with these branded TVs.\n",

When I tried to buy it, I found out that it was sold out and the waiting list was full.  I contacted Amazon and complained.  I waited for prime day to buy it at what I thought was the lowest price, but the next day the price was lower.  I requested that I should be charged the lowest price since I bought it on during prime day.  They said they had no knowledge of it being offered at such a low price.  I was so upset that I was going to not accept the television and have it sent back.

      "I’ve been putting off getting a tv for my bedroom. Prime day came, I scored!  I have looked at every friggin tv out there and always put the iPad down and backed away. When buzz started about a $99 tv for prime day I was ready. I found the tv on pre sale and started watching the deal. When it went live at 8:00 am day two of prime day……I was headed to an appointment!!  I pulled over, clicked this baby into the cart, and in 6 minutes, the deal was claimed, but I got mine!  The whole idea of having a tv shipped was making me a bit crazy. I mean, cmon, we’ve all seen some pretty haggard boxes showing up on our door steps that went thru the shipping process. This box arrived as if they had just picked it off the tv assembly line and dropped it on my porch. Perfection!  Next, unboxing, assembly and setup.  Easy, easy and easy!  Opened box, attach legs, place in room, plug in!  This 4K tv has a great picture. Menu looks exactly like the fire stick I’m running on the den tv, and, it has pretty decent sound with no sound bar attached. Perfect for the bedroom. Even at regular price, it’s a great deal. But when you apply a $10.00 gift card, and $5 bucks of credit card points…….Best $84 bucks I’ve spent in quite awhile. Highly recommended.\n",

The downside is that once the TV is turned off it reverts back to the Home Screen when turned back on. You then need to change the input in order to get to cable TV or whatever other source you choose. It’s a very quick press of a few buttons though and you get used to it pretty quickly.

      "I recently bought the 43 in fire tv. I love the tv. It has a great picture, sounds good, easy to install, and very user friendly. I gave it four stars instead of five because it is not possible to attach my hearing aid streamer directly to the tv. The set comes with blue tooth, digital audio connection(spdif), and 3.5mm head phone jack. That is all fine and good until I tried to connect my hearing aids through bluetooth or my streamer to any of the two other audio connections. When you connect to any of the three audio connections the sound from the speakers cut out. It would be great if the setup gave you the option of turning off the built in speakers or leaving them on. Unfortunately, many of the current tv models have done away with the RCA jacks. I managed to work around this issue by connecting an audio extraction device to the hdmi eArc port. The device extracts the audio and you have the option of using the spdif, RCA jacks and/or the headphone jack. I now connect my hearing aid streamer to the spdif connector. I then had to connect my stereo to the RCA jacks because, you guessed it, the built in tv speakers turned off. My wife seems satisfied with this arrangement, and I can hear the dialog again.Lou\n",

      "I purchased the 55\" for my father.  The TV was easy to set up.  I mean what TV isn't but for some reason people find that important to know.  Setup was fine just log into an amazon account and you're good to go.  The biggest issue I have with this TV by far doesn't really even have to do with the TV.  It has everything to do with the Fire TV interface which is the same interface used for fire sticks, Prime video etc.  Its super clunky and confusing.  It's riddled with advertisements for Amazon products and other apps.  Its just a horrible interface that Amazon doesn't seem to want to put any effort what so ever into making it a better experience.  That being said.  I hooked up a Roku Ultra and all problems solved.  Unfortunately there isn't a setting to make the TV turn on to a specific Input which is disappointing as you have to manually select the input for the Roku every time the TV is turned on.  There also doesn't seem to be any support for the Roku remote controlling the TV however this could just be a Roku issue.  So you are stuck using the Amazon remote to power the TV and adjust the volume.  Which is another issue.  The remote is incredibly cheap and flimsy.  Its the same remote you get with a $25 fire stick.  The picture quality is just OK.  The colors are bright but just a little off out of the box.  4K video is a little grainy and slightly choppy with a lot of movement.  The choppiness is typical for lower end 4k TV's so that's  fine but the grain is a bit disappointing.  Granted $429 for a 55\" television is is on the lower end of the price range but similarly priced Televisions come with HDR.  Overall its fine.  But if I were purchasing another \"cheap\" television I would go with another brand.  There are better options out there.  TCL's 55\" Roku TV is cheaper, has HDR and a better picture quality.\n",

      "I decided on the Amazon 43\" Fire TV for my outdoor enclosed patio mainly because all of my other TV's stream via 4K FireSticks. I also selected this TV because it is relatively inexpensive and I wouldn't have to pay for another FireStick.When the TV arrived, I first checked the box for damage and found none. After opening the box and removing the TV, I found it to be terribly damaged. The screen was all bent and broken. I'm really not sure how that could have happened without any visible damage to the box. Either the TV was damaged before it was boxed (unlikely) or the protective packaging itself is lacking the strength to resist careless handling in shipping. The TV is only protected in the box by two long pieces of styrofoam, one across the top and one across the bottom, which leaves the entire middle of the screen unprotected if the box is laid flat and heavy objects are placed on top of it during shipping. In any event, there was a free return policy on this TV so it didn't cost me anything to ship it back. Amazon quickly replaced the TV and the second one arrived in good condition.The quality of the picture is what I would call average at this price point....not bad, but not as good as a higher end model that you'd expect to pay more for. I own a Samsung Q90 model which has a much better picture, but to be fair, that's like comparing apples to oranges. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase of this TV.If you're ordering a wall mount for this TV, the VESA bolt pattern is 300 X 300, and most smaller mounts will not work with this TV. This TV comes with 4 screws already installed and ready to use for mounting, so you can be sure that you will have the correct screws when fastening the mount to the TV. Most mounts do come with screws, but I have read a lot of complaints that those screws are either too long, too short or the wrong size. You won't have to worry about that with this TV.Setup is a breeze and Alexa works well. One of the really nice features about having Alexa on a TV is that you can program Alexa to access some security cameras on your home network... Ring devices being one of them. Once you set up your cameras and make them visible to Alexa on the Alexa App, all you need to do is press the Alexa button on the remote and say \"Alexa show me the front door\" (or whatever you named your cameras) and a live image from the camera will pop up on your TV screen. To exit the image all you need to do is press the back button on the remote.\n",

Mounted on slides so easy to get to rear panel.RCA 5 digit remote (has numeric keypad, can control 3 devices) code was 12434, same as many, many other smart TVs. 4-digit (Philips) 2851.Should pay for self in about 4 months since now streaming & OTA (102 channels) ( dash on remote does not work but TV understands whole numbers).Not the greatest status symbol but also \"value priced\". White box on top is for Bose system so TV sound is unimportant.Was hand delivered to my door by careful driver who called first. Only question now is longevity but makes captions easier to read than previous 43\" TV..ps I do not find the blue light on the bottom objectionable. If I did, a small piece of electrical tape should block.Update: since I receive over 100 OTA channels, I need a numeric keypad. The problem I found is that the Fire TV apparently has a two stage turn off. The first only lasts for about five minutes, then \"changes\" and needs a different signal.. The codes above cannot turn the TV back on once it reaches the second stage.The RCA cannot handle this but the three device Philips SRP3219G/27  remote allows multiple codes. 2851 can handle everything except the second stage turn on. Codes 1091 or 6091 can provide the turn on but not much else so I programmed the \"TV\" button to 2851 and the \"STR\" for 1091. That works for me.pps the lighter color Philips remotes are easier to see the buttons.\n",

      "Luckily I managed to purchase this TV on sale since I needed to retire my old Toshiba unit in my bedroom.The size works perfect and has great picture quality (better than my 50\" Samsung in living room) and it is highly responsive to remote inputs.Compared to using a Fire TV Stick, this unit operates much faster when making selections and so far has been less problematic than some of my F TV Sticks on other TV's.The Amazon house branded one is even better than the Insignia with Fire TV that my roommate has.I have seen a number of people complain about the light on the bottom of the TV being too bright when it is turned off, but I have not had that issue with mine. So unless you are very sensitive sleeper, I wold not worry about this issue at all.\n",

      "The TV is really nice, looks great and integrates with Roku speakers.But my primary usecase is using Xfinity cable service.  The default when powered on is Amazon.I would prefer it to remember the last HDMI selection and start with that.  As it is now, I have to use two remotes... The Fire remote to change SOURCE (Which is in settings and not on a button); then use the Xfinity remote to do other things.  I get it... This is an attempt to move everyone over to Amazon by default, but I can't do that just now.  It would be nice if it remembered the HDMI selection between power cycles.I have not tried controlling it with voice via Alexa.  Perhaps I can tell her to change to HDMI1?  That would be better, but still not as nice as remembering the selection.Update (07/06/22):  The voice control on the remote WILL change the HDMI Source.  That makes changing source much easier. Also, Depending on how you turn it on (from the included Fire Remote or a paired Xfinity remote) it will change source to the the last setting.  If I turned it off with the XFinity remote, then use it to turn it back on... It will come on to the Fire home page, but a few moments later, change the the previous HDMI (and sound) settings.  I'm upping my rating to 5 Star.I was really enjoying the 4K resolution, and noting that the picture is really goodAlso, works with my Roku soundbar.  That makes two streaming options and cable as my sources.\n",

      "I still have to get up and walk to the TV to read texts and notes on screen. The apps close after about 15 minutes so there’s not a pause function except for a short time. Occasionally it forgets what episode I was on so I have to remember where I was before each pause in case I don’t get back before it times out and I have to go searching to continue. There’s an app supposed to fix this but I haven’t downloaded yet. This TV seems unaware of the apps I pay for and have downloaded and is always suggesting more apps I can pay for but don’t want. I would prefer that it knows what I want to watch and list those separately instead of mixed in with everything possible to watch. This TV doesn’t turn off. It always goes to sleep mode.

Not that bad but if you want a super vivid picture I’d look somewhere else.People also complained about the bright blue stand by light that will light up a dark room.

      "Pros: The quality of the picture and audio are great. Lots of options to customize it to your liking. Switching between apps is quick and easy.Apps keep their memory, just like phones, so if you exit an app or even turn off the TV, it will be in the same place when you return.You can name each input device, which is neat. There's not many input slots though, at least compared to other TV's.I never use Alexa so that feature isn't included in my review.Cons: The biggest gripe I have is that the TV will shut off if there's no activity for 15 minutes. There is no way to keep the TV from going to sleep after the max 15 minutes, unless you go through hoops by downloading an app on your phone and transferring said app to the TV. And even then, you have to go into the app and turn it on to keep the TV from sleeping each and every time you turn on your TV. That sucks big time and makes me regret purchasing this TV. It is such a frequent problem that seems like such an easy fix if they included the option to turn off auto sleep, like any other TV.Others complained about a light that the TV has while it is off. It is true that there is a white light underneath the TV whenever the TV is off, but it is very dim, about the intensity of a digital clock, so it never bothered me at all. Don't know why they added it in though. I can see why others are bothered by it. Another stupid design decision.Another issue I had was that there are times when the TV will have it's controls delayed for a few seconds, like volume. It stalls and takes a few seconds for each press to register. This happens very rarely, so it's not a big issue. When it happens, you have to go to the options menu and restart the TV fully. Pressing the power button on the remote will only put the TV to sleep. It needs to shut off fully.Conclusion: While I love the ease and speed of switching between apps, the sleep issue is so big that I can't recommend this TV. It ruins the experience for me. Everything else can be overlooked by the quality of the smart features.\n",

      "Well, figured this TV would be a no brainer.  I mean, price was decent, and it had plenty of features.  I had already had a fire stick, and while I personally prefer the Roku interface for its simplicity, I figured we could bypass all that stuff and simply use this TV as a display only for my 90 something year old parents.Boy, was I wrong.  This thing is a horror show to use as a regular TV connected to a cable box.  There's almost no scenario where you can simply just turn it on and have it play cable channels, which is what the older generation is used to, ie, you cannot reliably have it turn on to specific HDMI port, so the only thing they have to deal with is the cable remote.Nope, you need to fiddle with totally miniature remote for this Fire TV, turn it on, then manually move to the little gear/settings selector on the TV, then select the HDMI port that the cable box is connected to.  Every....  Single....  Time....  Its rendered the TV mostly useless, as not only can't they understand what that means, but they can't even see the microscopic remote.Now, there is a setting that claims to allow the TV to turn on to the last HDMI port active, but this works about 1 out of every 50 times, at best.So all in all, a reasonable TV for most younger people, but for the older generation among us, avoid at all costs.  Oh, and FYI, I did try to deal with the atrocious remote by getting a remote targeted toward seniors and low vision people.  It took hours of code searching to find the correct code, but it only marginally works.  And still, the HDMI port selection problem makes the TV all but useless.Finally, the Fire TV software on this particular TV seems like a giant cartoon like advertising system.  I love prime TV, and use it often, but this Fire interface makes even Prime programming hard to navigate.In conclusion, this TV is only good for those that love Amazon (which I generally do), younger people that can handle the microscopic remote, and those that only stream and have no cable, which I do realize is now a large portion of the population (myself included).\n",

She was *wonderful*. Smart, helpful, super personable and funny. And--on par with standard huge-corporation standards--she couldn't find the documentation needed to help me fix the issue.We were on the phone for a long time, and then I finally realized that you can turn off the awful motion smoothing and other terrible standard features *only* if you go to the video settings *within the app you're using* (Netflix, Hulu, etc.).For the love of all of the gods, why wouldn't something so basic be present in the general settings??!!!!! You know, so a \"smart\" TV can be like, intuitive? (Alexa was also total crap in this regard.)Anywho then, revised review: general smart features are great, Bluetooth is a little weird, figuring out how to change video settings to avoid ruining the experience is completely asinine, counterintuitive, and maddening.Maybe Bezos can fix that last point whenever he's done taking celebrities to space.(\"Come on, Jeffrey, you can do it...\")\n",

(I got it on sale)But there are definitely some major and minor annoyances.1: (Pictured) The TV arrived with 2 dark/distorted parts on the bottom of the screen, they’re not super noticable unless the colors in that area are very bright, but still pretty annoying.2: Every once and a while (like once every few weeks)  the TV will tweak out and it will flash between the video and a black screen. This problem does correct itself if you cycle on and off.3: Sometimes it doesnt want to detect inputs unless I cycle the TV on and off.4: Sometimes it doesn’t want to detect optical audio until I cycle on and off.5: Its been telling me the battery in the remote is critically low since we got it… like it’s a remote, if the batteries die I’ll replace them, but seeing as it’s been about 2 months-ish since I got the TV I don’t think your low battery detection is really smart enough to warrant changing the battery just because it asked me to do so.6: My final complaint is that this TV is set to always start on the “home screen” by default, and it was not self explanatory on how to change it to start on the last input it was on. I play a lot of xbox, I really dont care about the TV’s homescreen.Final words: It may seem like a lot of complaints, but most of my problems (besides the remote thing) are infrequent, and if you get this TV on sale like I did, I think its a great value for the money.\n",

The only drawback was this: If you live in a house built prior to the 70's (and maybe even the 80's) when there were very few electrical outlets installed, then you might have some difficulty with the power cord length.  I could have used up to 3 more feet of length.  Aside from that, I am quite happy with the unit.\n",

      "So far this TV has been well worth the money.  I've only had it for about two weeks at present, but it's been working perfectly.  Plenty of HDMI inputs, and the USB port is great for a 4TB HDD on which I have a bunch of TV shows and movies in mp4 format.  The WiFi connection is strong and adding any apps I needed/wanted was a cinch, as was signing into them, which is made much easier by using a computer.The picture is great, and streaming in 4k looks fantastic, though 1080p and 720p items look great as well, the latter two of which are the resolutions of the aforementioned movies and TV shows on the HDD, respectively.  I also tried wirelessly casting from both my M1 Mac Mini and my AM02 Windows mini pc, and it worked flawlessly.  It has all of the expected settings to adjust the picture and sound.The sound, while not great, is adequate, though I wouldn't expect sound from little speakers to be spectacular anyway.  It would be easy to add better sound via speakers connected to the optical port, but for now the built in sound is good enough.My only real complaint thus far is with the built in Media Player.  I have my movies and TV shows sorted by folders and subfolders on the HDD, and the media player shows every folder on the disk in one big group.  In my case that's over 1000 folders.  I can sort them alphabetically, but if I want to watch something near the end of the alphabet, such as 'V for Vendetta', I have to scroll through 1000+ folders to get to it, which takes upwards of five minutes or more, and is tedious and extremely annoying.  Luckily, I found MX Player, which is an app available for the TV that sorts the folders as intended, such as clicking into the 'Films' folder, then the 'V' folder, then the title folder, then clicking the mp4 to play it.  MX Player also has a lot of useful settings adjustments for playback.  Either Amazon should revamp their Media Player app or include an already installed alternative like MX Player.All in all this has been a great TV so far.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive 4k TV.  No, it's not a $1000 TV with all the bells and whistles and the best of everything, but for the price it's a great choice.\n",

It's nothing fancy, and the sound quality, leaves much to be desired, but for a cheap, budget tv, it's not bad.There was no noticeable issues with the tv (such as a busted screen, pixels, etc...).So if you're looking for something cheap, and decent, it's not a bad choice.\n",

      "Everything has been great with our new fire tv! We recently upgraded since our old one was smaller and kept bugging out after 2 years of usage. The screen on this one isn’t anything super fancy, but we got an incredible deal on it and it’s working wonders so far! Plus we had everything on a fire stick with our precious tv, so this new one was able to recover all of our previous settings with no problem. I definitely recommend for a budget friendly smart tv.\n",

As far as picture quality for the price it’s pretty good. HDR10 looks amazing and very clear and I found it to be more than bright enough. Yes You can find better TVs with brighter HDR and Dolby Vision but you will pay twice as much. I have 4 other TVs with Dolby vision and the difference isn’t a deal breaker for me.If you need a replacement TV and can live without Dolby Vision you will not be disappointed with this one.

      "I purchased this to use for my kid’s pc as a monitor. I know, TVs will never perform as good as dedicated monitors. But my kid doesn’t care about refresh rates or color accuracy. She only wants to do her homework and play her Roblox on a bigger screen.It lasted 3 days. Here is why. First it doesn’t automatically wake up when you move the mouse, as expected.  No points taken away there. However, every TV I’ve used before as a monitor will remember that I’m connected to whatever source I used last when powered on. This TV does not. It forces you additional steps to go re-select the source that you want displayed. The second thing is lag. My kid’s computer isn’t a gaming powerhouse, but it isn’t ancient tech either (10th Gen i3, 16gb DDR4, SSD, nVidia GTX 1080), Mouse lag on this is barely usable. The cursor is constantly playing catch up with your actual mouse movements. Lastly, picture quality. It’s 4k, but looks worse than my QHD monitors. The TV “does” have a PC mode, but text still isn’t the sharpest. Oh and that doesn’t fix the mouse lag either. Colors are really bad on it,  but can be adjusted somewhat and subjective so that’s not a negative.So now it’s her “new” bedroom TV, and it works great as that. I feel for the price it’s worth every penny for its intended use. Just don’t use it as a computer monitor.\n",

The details make me feel like I’m watching all my favorite movies for the first time!The settings have been pretty easy to adjust but it can be slow getting the menu to pop up sometimes.And like others have said, the glaring light when the tv is off can be annoying, but I have it high enough up on a bookcase that I usually don’t see it when I’m laying down. Something to consider though if you can’t stand bright lights while sleeping!Overall, I think the picture quality outweighs the bright light and I would still choose this one over other options 👍🏻\n",

      "I wanted to state first of all, this TV is a fantastic value for the money.  The picture quality is very good, better than a comparable Roku TV.  There are sufficient inputs, and features in line with other smart devices on the market today.  I'm using the ARC feature to output audio to our AV Receiver and it sounds fantastic, and controls the AVR as I would expect.  Now the downside.  If you use the TV for a little while, and switch between apps, it will refuse to return to the home screen.  It will instead either switch back to the last app you were using, or the app you were using prior to this one.  There are ways to get around it, such as opening the settings menu and clicking on \"my apps\", or rebooting the TV, but overall this bug takes away from a fundamental use of the TV, and would give me pause before purchasing another one.  Again, I think the hardware itself is a phenomenal value, and if Amazon is able to release a patch for this issue, I'd consider changing my score upwards, but usability is drastically affected by this issue.\n",

After I provided the order number…from Amazon, I was told I was being given a “one time exception” to unblock it.  Lol, a one time exception for what? I bought it from YOUR website.  After waiting 24hrs for it to “reset”, the TV is working as it should.  The quality is great, and I’m happy with the product.  It appears my experience may be unique, but if you encounter the same issue, call customer support and provide an order number and you’ll be good to go in 1-24hrs.***ORIGINAL REVIEW ***I cannot remember a time where I’ve had difficulty setting up a single device in my home.  This includes game systems, PCs, laptops, several TVs, smart thermostats, etc.  This TV (and maybe I just received a lemon) has been an absolute pain.- prompting a checking for updates before I could login.  Then telling me it could not update and to contact support.  Attempted to back out so I could login to the WiFi.  IMMEDIATELY goes back to checking for updates mid-login.- attempted to register the device several times.  Had my wife type in the email and password to make sure I wasn’t messing up because I was frustrated.  Verified the email and password from the TV with the one saved in my phone.  Then I changed the password to make sure it was indeed the one I was typing in - to no avail.- been working w/ customer support for over an hour.  I am honestly excited for when it works, but not a strong start.\n",

      "I got one of these at Prime Day pricing of 200 bucks and I was so pleased with the impressive quality - especially at that price point - that I ordered a second one! I had recently moved into a new apartment and didn't have any television (I'd gifted my old one to my kid and grandkids before I left). Now I have a 43\" Fire TV 4 series in both my living room (primarily for video games) and in my bedroom (for lounging and catchin' up on my stories). I am extremely happy with the purchases. I mean, for $400, I have two excellent tv's for under the price of one comparable competitor product! Hard to beat that kind of deal.Pro tip: if you go to watch your favorite modern program or film and you get the \"soap opera effect\", where everything looks to real, like you're standing in the studio or it was filmed by the BBC...there is an easy fix! On your remote, hit the settings button (gear icon). Scroll down to Picture. Scroll down to Advanced Settings. Scroll down to Natural Cinema - turn that on. Option B: right under that setting, you can adjust the severity of the \"Motion Smoothing\". Some stuff looks doper with some smoothing! Try level 7, for instance.\n",

      "I think they took the name a little too seriously.I wish they'd take my return request more seriously. I've had this TV for 2 short months.It got light use... maybe 5-6 hours per day. We've got some TVs here in this house, Samsung, Vizio, TCL, that stay on 24/7 in some cases.My new fire TV had been on for about an hour when the screen suddenly went dark. I tried the old IT trick of 'turning it off and back on again' ... nothing.I turned it back off and let it sit off for a few minutes and when I tried again, the screen 'backlight' came on, but no image. I tried pressing different app buttons & home button etc. on the remote to no avail.I then went to remove the power cable thinking if I left if off power for a minute, maybe I could get it to 'reset' and then power it back up ... when I reached for the cable on the back, I could smell that burnt PCB smell ... If you've worked in electronics, you know what a charred SMD (surface mount device) smells like.. I had been sitting in the dark watching the TV so when I quickly turned on the light I was surprised to see a small haze of smoke still hanging above the TV.I reported this 2 days ago and was told immediately that it was under warranty, but they couldn't process a return for me... What?!They wanted to forward me to another tech support group. I thought .. OK, the TV fried... I'd want to know why myself, so I can understand pushing my ticket to another department.Then a day later I was contacted by someone asking for pictures of the sides, front, and back ... so I immediately took pictures and sent them over. Today I've called to inquire about the status of my return, and was told \"They are still reviewing your device\" ...How are they reviewing something that is unplugged and sitting on my table? The pictures?! How long does it take to look at 4 pictures?I'm truly bummed about this too ... The TV had an amazing picture. The 4K UHD screen was about as crisp as I could have hoped for. The internal audio (usually not ideal on a flat panel) was really good and full.This TV had impressed me more than any TV I'd bought in the last 15 years....and then the smoke came out.2 months TV rental for $200 is not worth it ... I understand that things fail. Stuff breaks... I get it.But stand behind your policy and product.If it broke under normal use then replace it quickly so the customer isn't without the product for which they paid.Within minutes of writing this review I was contacted by Customer Service again... They offered me a UPS shipping label and instructed me to bring it to my local UPS store. I informed the customer svc rep, Luis, that I did not have the original box to use for shipping. He told me this wasn't a problem, and that UPS would take care of the packaging/boxing for me.Upon arriving at UPS and wasting another 20 minutes of my time standing in line, I was surprised to hear from the UPS rep that I would be responsible for the shipping costs and that the return process with Amazon would not include the price of packaging/boxing.Don't buy this. Don't waste your time. Spend the extra few bucks and go to your local store. Go to a mom & pop Tv store if any still exist in your area. At least you'll have somewhere to bring it should it fail.\n",

Built in Apps like Netflix, Amazon and YouTube TV work as expected and very easy to set up.The controller works fine.  I'm not a speak into the controller type of guy so that had little value for me.  I'm also not a home automation guy (via internet) ...  Therefore those tools built into this tv aren't that valuable to me, however I suspect if I was sitting on my couch watching a show and wanted to take a look at home automation from the tv, it might be of value to others.The TV looks great and is sturdy on its feet.I was very surprised that it had the large form-factor wall mount tv mount.  It might have been in the instructions.  So if you buy this, note that it takes a tv mount like big tv's.I have two things that knocked the performance to perfect 5 stars.1) I am undecided whether the picture quality is comperable to my other 43\" units.  If I find it was a hookup, I'll amend this review.  But overall the picture looks great, but maybe it is in a little bit of an oversaturation mode.  I have not tried to go into the settings to fine tune it yet.For streamed TV, the imagery looks generally good, however I use it with my computer most often and compared to two other 43\" 4k monitors, it seems not as sharp.2) This is pretty minor, but the tv doesn't seem to remember that the last device that I was using was hdmi.  Its easy to fix.  Of my 3 43\"ers one of the 3 does a good job of this.While my rating doesn't show 5, I would probably rate this TV at about 4.85So don't let the non-5 affect you selecting this device.

A few weird things about it. The horribly shaped/angled feet (just why?) mounted is for sure the only way if you don't want to be constantly bothered by that. Amazon wants to control the experience, I get that but when they are screwing it up they need to have options for power users. I can't connect my echo studios or sub (WHICH IS ADVERTISED ON THE PRODUCT PAGE!) because the app says it's not compatible. Well digging into it, I think my devices isn't on the latest OS version. It says it's on 7.2.4.0 but the site says latest is 7.2.7.9. Check for updates, up to date. Reset TV, up to date. Yet it's not! Support is a joke. If it wasn't for me letting the tv sit in the box for 7 months, I would return it but I'm stuck with it even though it can't do the one thing I want it to.\n",

It's toward the lower end of the pile in the broad scheme of things (it's nowhere near OLED quality) but this is about how much you are getting for the dollar.

      "This TV has some great qualities and some bad. The picture quality is amazing. Even on the old shows like Murder She Wrote. It's slim & light weight. Pretty easy to install. Alexa did most of the work. Now for the bad. About once a week it won't turn on. I have to get behind the dresser and unplug it. Not too bad unless you've just gotten comfy under the electric blanket on a cold winters night. Usually it resets okay after that. There's a bright light in the center at the base which comes on brighter when the tv goes off! Super silly and irritating in the bedroom. I tried duct tape, but then the tv wouldn't turn on, so I'm guessing it's part of the remote sensor. So there you go, gotta get back out of bed and cover it with something so we can sleep. I mean it's bight! Then there's the fact that it won't pare with dish network remote. I guess if you have the hopper it will, but if not forget it. You can get to your dish programs and your dvr, but you've got to connect to the tv then hit the arrow on the left, and then go to the antenna button and if all goes well it will open up dish. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for everything to get connected. Also then your stuck with using two remotes. The dish remote to pick your programs and fast forward etc. And the tv remote for volume, on, off etc. It all works but I do miss my old simple tv that just came on, went right to dish and that was that. The program selection on the smart tv is amazing and despite the issues I will keep going with it.\n",

      "To free up space, we decided to look for a smart Tv that didn’t require anything plugged into it to access streaming/apps(Xbox/Roku stick/etc) so we went with this TV and are honestly very impressed. The picture quality is good with very vibrant colors. The sound is also very loud and clear without having to use a sound bar. The TV itself was incredibly lightweight as well. I was able to mount it on our wall by myself due to it being so light.The TV remote is very sleek and slender, and very responsive. There’s no lag, or freezing when navigating the apps or menu screens. And while I don’t use the Alexa feature, the times I have just to test it out I’ve had no problems.Is this the “end all be all” of TV’s? No. Im sure you can find much higher end TV’s with much better picture quality but unless you have some strange desire to be able to see every drop of sweat on someone’s face, or every grain of sand on Tatooine in Mandalorian, then you really don’t need anything more than this. The price of this TV with everything you get with it makes it the best value I could’ve ever asked for in a TV and I’m beyond impressed and satisfied with it.*disclaimer* I use this TV strictly for watching shows and movies. So if you’re looking for something to play next gen video games on, you may need to look else where, although I don’t see it being that much of an issue for a casual gamer.\n",

      "Understanding that Amazon doesn't actually make this tv, and obviously not a lot of experience with the same, it would have been nice to know ahead of time that in a lot of cases...  no matter whether it's something from Prime Video, or Hulu, or Netflix, or any of your other streaming apps....  you're probably not going to get a lot of programming that will be shown full screen.  With today's modern technology there shouldn't be any reason to have to watch a program that has 4\" black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  Even when Amazon only had available the various models of the Firestick ( of which I had the latest generation before purchasing this tv ) if that happened, all you had to do was use the tv remote and switch the viewing mode to WIDE or ZOOM then change it back after the programming was over.  You would think that in this day and age that would have been a consideration.... I was doing this before on a 27\" Magnavox tv that was at least 8 years old.  Technology sure has changed but not sure that people are getting any smarter...  just my thoughts. If horizontal bars and not getting the full use of your 50\" screen doesn't bother you....  no worries !!!\n",

      "I really wanted to give 5 stars to this TV but cannot.Let me start with what I like:- Easy to setup- Lots of apps- Picture is very good for lower cost TV- The guide for local channels and others for app really coolNow what I do not like:- The off-air tuner is very cheaply made. My 8-year-old Vizio NEVER pixelated when watching over the air TV. This TV does it often. All I did was attach RG-6U coax from the existing outdoor antenna bought two years ago and this FireTV pixelates. Again, I never had issue with old Vizio or any other TV's in home NEVER pixelate (even in storms).- Voice does not sync with lips. Over the air TV, apps like Philo, Hulu and others are never synced. There is always a voice/lips issue on every app. Devices attached via HDMI are really bad.- Can only add a handful of apps to favorites. You have to go searching. Some engineer decided I only need 5-6 favorite apps and should spend my time searching for my others.I could go on, but do not have the time.Overall, good TV for the garage or outdoor patio (in protective cover). Just cannot recommend for the main living room TV.Maybe I will change this rating if Amazon engineers fix their software and send me a new TV that does not pixelate:)EDIT: I think the software updates have fixed some issues, so I have added a star! Lips sync (audio / lips) has improved over the last two software updates, so loving Amazon Fire TV even more.\n",

      "Why?When my 7-year-old 42\" Samsung started showing faint vertical lines across the screen, I took the hint and went hunting for a replacement. I prospected all across the wide Internet, finding some brands that might be popular in the Gobi Desert, but I kept drifting back to the Amazon Fire TV. And what's better than a 42\"? Why a 55\" TV of course! It showed up at my apartment door, and I'm sure the Amazon delivery person wasn't smiling at how large the box was, but at least I'm on the first floor.Set-UpImportant note: When the instructions say \"Requires 2 persons,\" GET two persons to pull the unit out of the box and set it on the stand/mount.The actual set up went very well. Since I had purchased the unit from Amazon, it immediately recognized my profile and I was in business. However, I had to log in to Disney+, Hulu and Netflix. I paired it with a Sony sound bar and I'm good to go! Setup took all of 15 minutes.  Five stars.The picture quality is outstanding. My old Samsung is eating its transistorized heart out in envy.RemoteThe remote includes designated buttons for Prime, Netflix, Disney and Hulu, plus there's a handy button for a guide showing other programming (i.e.: Pluto). I'm impressed. Five stars.PriceI found the price to be reasonable when including all the technology in the TV. (Of course there are cheaper TVs on the market, and if cheap is what you want, cheap is what you're gonna get.)  Five stars.Any complaintsI read some reviews for this TV complaining about the blue pilot light at the bottom edge of the screen, but it has never bothered me. Amazon may have solved the problem in the months since the review was posted and today.Bottom LineGo for it.\n",

Because I have lots of DVDs and Blu-rays I upgraded my Blu-ray player too. The Fire TV requires that your extensions be connected via HDMI connection. The television defaults to your SMART features  every time you power on the television. You’ll find the apps you use most often and the recent shows/movies you’ve watched on your Home screen. If you already have a Fire Stick, your preferences sync for you making the transition from the stick to the tv easy.  The picture is bright and crisp. The sound is satisfactory.

It was easy to attach with the vesa holes and setting it all up was easy. The TV itself was easy for me to move around, attach the stand, etc., and I purchased the 50 inch model. The pictures clarity is amazing. My old tv was a 2009 Samsung and it's night and day. That's how much of an improvement the Amazon Fire TV is compared to an older name brand TV. I did purchase a sound bar and literally between the sound bar and the TV, I felt like I was watching a movie in a theater. I don't post reviews very often but the TV has impressed me. I do have cable hook up and may end that once my contract expires and the interface on the tv switching between cable or the smart tv options is the same as the fire stick I have on a smaller bedroom tv. Again, I was able to take out if the box, attach to a tv stand and place on a table with no assistance in probably less that 10 minutes. The 50 inch tv weighs around 25 lbs but it's not awkward to handle. Well worth your while to give the tv a try as opposed to more expensive name brand models.\n",

      "I still have to get up and walk to the TV to read texts and notes on screen. The apps close after about 15 minutes so there’s not a pause function except for a short time. Occasionally it forgets what episode I was on so I have to remember where I was before each pause in case I don’t get back before it times out and I have to go searching to continue. There’s an app supposed to fix this but I haven’t downloaded yet. This TV seems unaware of the apps I pay for and have downloaded and is always suggesting more apps I can pay for but don’t want. I would prefer that it knows what I want to watch and list those separately instead of mixed in with everything possible to watch. This TV doesn’t turn off. It always goes to sleep mode. I bought this because it fits on my dresser and only weighs 20 lb so I can move it by myself and don’t have to hang on wall. It’s not very user friendly but overall I’m happy with it.\n",

      "I needed to upgrade the television in my bedroom. I selected the 43 inch Fire TV.  The SMART features available are extensive, and the television has multiple HDMI connections.  Because I have lots of DVDs and Blu-rays I upgraded my Blu-ray player too. The Fire TV requires that your extensions be connected via HDMI connection. The television defaults to your SMART features  every time you power on the television. You’ll find the apps you use most often and the recent shows/movies you’ve watched on your Home screen. If you already have a Fire Stick, your preferences sync for you making the transition from the stick to the tv easy.  The picture is bright and crisp. The sound is satisfactory. If you want the full “movie” experience, I suggest you buy a sound bar. I’m pleased with my purchase, and will consider a bigger screen Fire TV when I need to replace other televisions in my house.\n",

I waited for prime day to buy it at what I thought was the lowest price, but the next day the price was lower.

I was so upset that I was going to not accept the television and have it sent back.

      "First let me start off by saying that I purchased a table top tv stand as I feel more comfortable with that kind of set up opposed to the standard legs n smart tv's. It was easy to attach with the vesa holes and setting it all up was easy. The TV itself was easy for me to move around, attach the stand, etc., and I purchased the 50 inch model. The pictures clarity is amazing. My old tv was a 2009 Samsung and it's night and day. That's how much of an improvement the Amazon Fire TV is compared to an older name brand TV. I did purchase a sound bar and literally between the sound bar and the TV, I felt like I was watching a movie in a theater. I don't post reviews very often but the TV has impressed me. I do have cable hook up and may end that once my contract expires and the interface on the tv switching between cable or the smart tv options is the same as the fire stick I have on a smaller bedroom tv. Again, I was able to take out if the box, attach to a tv stand and place on a table with no assistance in probably less that 10 minutes. The 50 inch tv weighs around 25 lbs but it's not awkward to handle. Well worth your while to give the tv a try as opposed to more expensive name brand models.\n",

      "We lived with a 32\" \"dumb\" TV for years, relying on other devices to provide streaming content. When we decided to upgrade, we found the Amazon Fire TV 50\" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV. The size is perfect for our family of 4, much larger than the old 32\" screen, but not something that overwhelms our space. The picture quality is remarkable, and we run at about 60% backlighting and the picture is still super bright and clear. The TV comes pre-installed with many streaming providers, and setup was a breeze. Many other providers are available for download. I saw a number of reviews that complained of the light when TV is powered down; either Amazon heard this complaint and changed the lighting, or folks are a lot more sensitive to light than we are. The remote is small, yet easy to use. I haven't set up any voice commands, but the remote allows for voice commands. When we first set the system up, once we got the TV connected to wifi, a few downloads took place, the TV integrated with our prime account, and we were up and running in about 15-20 minutes. Since then, not one problem. I don't know why we waited this long to upgrade our viewing experience!\n",

First, I like that I can make payments with opening a credit card or entering one of those interesting financing schemes that everyone wants to introduce.  As for the TV itself, the picture quality is fine, and it was very easy to set up.  Just connect it to the internet and it will handle the rest.  For those concerned about Alexa, it is off by default.  As this is my only Alexa device, I won’t be using it.  Most popular streaming services are available on the TV.  If you have a Fire Stick, this is not much different.  As for gaming, I have a PS3 and PS4 connected (there are four HDMI 2.0 port with one being eArc) and the quality has been good for me.  I have not experienced any lag on the screen.  The display is 60Hz.  Some of the text may have a slight blur on the edges but not enough to cause issues in my opinion.  I only noticed it when the console was updating.  The remote is simple and it is Bluetooth, which I also paired a set of headphones for listening (I live in an apartment). So far, this is a great TV.Downsides?  The Fire TV app on iPhone, unless I haven’t found a way yet, does not allow to add apps to the TV from anywhere like Roku.  My biggest gripe has nothing to do with the TV but how it was delivered.  Amazon sent this package through USPS, which Amazon notified me that my package was left in the mailbox (yeah, ok. Lol).  USPS said that the package could not be left because no one was home and there was no secure place to leave it. I assumed I would have to make a trip to the post office.  Apparently, someone thought leaving a 55 inch television right next to the entrance door of an apartment building was a great idea.  No way anyone was going to steal it.  I’m glad no one stole it and it wasn’t damaged.  I’m still tinkering around with it and will update.\n",

Assuming I must have received a defective TV, I ordered a replacement. But no, it wasn't a fluke. The SAME issue happened with the second one. So while the TV technically worked, I was never able to get beyond initial setup due to its inability to connect to Wi-Fi.It also seems impossible to use a soundbar with it. I tried TWO different soundbars of different brands. I connected one using an optical cable, then tried a second using HDMI ARC. On both occasions the TV insisted on playing back sound from its own speakers in addition to the sound coming from the soundbar. This is DESPITE my having turned off the TV speakers from the settings menu. And then double and triple checking just to be sure. The settings absolutely confirm the speakers are off, and yet they are not. So it creates this double audio overlap that is out of sync and unfixable. And intolerable.In my complete frustration I decided to just go ahead and spend an extra $200 on a Sony TV. My mental health was worth the investment. And what do you know? The Sony connected IMMEDIATELY to my wifi. It didn't even hesitate. It also had no issues at all with my soundbar. I didn't even have to go into the settings just to make it work. Just plug and play. Not hope and pray.There's no excuse for why I had these issues on TWO of these TVs. I don't care how cheap or expensive something is, I at least expect it to perform as promised. Instead what I received was a nightmare packaged up in a TV-shaped box where it was ready to take my soul and every ounce of patience I had. It's a shame.

      "Bought this TV during the Prime day live event for $99.00. This was a great investment for the money. The setup was easy. The smart features work well and the picture quality is excellent. There are plenty of inputs for external devices which can be seen in the product details. I have mine connected to an broadcast antenna mounted in the attic and the reception is good. Naturally reception would be different for everyone and dependent on the distance of the TV antenna to the television station broadcast towers. If I ever need another TV I would probably purchase again even at the current price listed on Amazon.\n",

       " '\\nI\\'m happy and impressed with it.TV came well packaged and was easy to set up. Which is to be expected as Amazon is just slapping their FireTV OS guts and some branding on some TVs. But they still managed to get that Amazon feel across in the design and the accessories. I will say it would\\'ve been nice if they included an ethernet cable but I guess those saved pennies help their space program or something. Everything you need to get started is there with that minimalist Amazon appeal though. I was unpackaged, plugged in, and powered on in minutes.Set up was a breeze after waiting for an update to download and install. If you\\'re familiar with any of the Fire TV Sticks or other Amazon devices, everything here is familiar. I\\'m neck deep in the Amazon environment from Recast to Fire Sticks so this was an easy choice to take a flyer on. And yes, Recast works on this TV. So to the dozens of us that use it, worry not. The new Fire remote is handy and adds the extra stuff you need for full control of a TV while still being simple. Settings, channel up and down, Live TV, etc. are all there. I\\'m not the biggest fan of branded app buttons at the bottom of the remote as things go away and get renamed, but the more buttons the merrier. I\\'m sure they can be rebound to other apps.The introductory price of the 50\" was too good to pass up. But I will say all the regular prices are just high enough to not be complete bargains. I imagine modest discounts will come occasionally and will be well worth considering. And to be fair, these aren\\'t bare minimum or cheap TVs. You get some real bang for your buck. Above average picture quality and honestly the best \"smart\" integration I\\'ve seen in a TV. I know they added one \"premium\" feature of Dolby Vision to the two largest options of the OMNI series but I do wish they would\\'ve made a model with a few more bells and whistles. Especially ones geared towards \"gamers\" and their consoles. 120hz, VRR, stuff like that. Would\\'ve been a riskier business choice I suppose. I was shopping for a bedroom and 65\" or 75\" was just too big and DV wasn\\'t enough of an allure. But for an introductory line of TVs I think they struck the right balance of options in the two lines and prices points. I\\'m not a hands free voice user, so I didn\\'t mind choosing the more budget friendly 4-Series line. And again, the introductory price on the 50\" was a great deal. Borderline steal. I\\'m very satisfied.Back to the OS and its spectacular integration; It boots up quickly and is always one home button, button click away no matter what you\\'re doing or which input you\\'re on. Everything is snappy and loads quickly. Apple+, PS5, Prime Video, PLEX, Recast, etc. have all been tested and work/look great. There\\'s enough picture options to dial things in to your liking. I liked that Dynamic Backlight was off, but disappointed that Action Smoothing was cranked. But that\\'s me. You can adjust the picture settings for each input. AND for each individual app! Which is pretty amazing and useful. The TV did have input lag with the PS5 out of the box. One of the picture settings like MPEG filter or something was the culprit, but there is a dedicated \"game\" profile in the picture settings presets that solved everything. I could see this being a small oversight that leads to a couple unhappy experiences  (UPDATE: The TV received an update after launch that fixed this and it \\'should\\' choose the \"game\" profile automatically now). All the options you need are there to solve things though. I can\\'t wait to explore the nooks and crannies of this thing more. I definitely think they integrated the Fire OS directly to the TV really really well.Big thumbs up to Amazon on their first run with these branded TVs.\\n',\n",

Hard to beat that kind of deal.Pro tip: if you go to watch your favorite modern program or film and you get the \"soap opera effect\", where everything looks to real, like you\\'re standing in the studio or it was filmed by the BBC...there is an easy fix! On your remote, hit the settings button (gear icon). Scroll down to Picture. Scroll down to Advanced Settings. Scroll down to Natural Cinema - turn that on. Option B: right under that setting, you can adjust the severity of the \"Motion Smoothing\". Some stuff looks doper with some smoothing! Try level 7, for instance.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI’ll start off by saying this has been a good TV and I like most of the features - the picture is pretty clear, the integration with the remote is seamless, and the navigation has been intuitive. If all of your needs are met with the description above, or you don’t care about principle, I’d recommend this TV.With that being said, I’m tired of companies withholding popular apps that many people enjoy because it competes with one of their own (and in this case, inferior) products.Like many people, I love that nearly every smart TV has music streaming service functionality through downloadable apps. It’s in large part why I decided to purchase a smart TV.Amazon Music just doesn’t hold a candle to Spotify, and I was incredibly disappointed to discover that a TV with so many positive reviews was really just an Amazon marketplace with some popular third party streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) built in. Companies seem to have this chokehold on their own products that they promote at the expense of fan-favorite applications. It doesn’t prompt me to make an Amazon Music account - it just makes for a poor customer experience.I mean - Pandora is available! So where are the other music streaming services?Amazon, listen to your customer base and PLEASE add Spotify to your list of available apps for download. Although this seems unlikely, I’m hopeful that the app is just in development and we will see an update soon.\\n',\n",

The choice is ultimately yours but I’m just trying to help with this review after spending a lot of time trying to find what I thought was the TV right for me.I unpacked my TV. and setup the legs but kept all the plastic “protective” film on it and turned it on. All was well when suddenly the screen went black while it was on the idle screen awaiting for me to find my wifi password. I wasn’t even able to get through the setup process (language choice and wifi network options) before the screen glitched and left it black. I have tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, different batteries in the remote, etc. The light on the bottom turns on when plugged in but does not respond to the remote now. Condition looks great aesthetically, no damage to the box it was shipped in, etc.Even if you did buy one and it worked, I cannot feel confident that a good working condition version of this TV would even last that long if this one is malfunctioning the way it is already.I am just trying to save someone like me the time it takes to return something like this. I’ll be dropping it off for a return tomorrow.P.S. My video is awful but shows the tv plugged in and the attempt to turn it on after it’s malfunction. Buy it if you’d like, the price point is there, but just know the quality is not. Happy holidays!\\n',\n",

They did not use standard machine screw threading for the wall mount, no one at Amazon knows what the proper screw for the TV is, and they did not include them with TV because someone at Amazon has a walnut for a brain. As mentioned in other reviews, the picture is garbage and the sound might as well be non-existent. This is basically a TV designed to sell you more crap from Amazon at the cheapest possible price point. It is a Chinese manufactured piece of garbage loaded with adware. You can get a Hisense from Walmart for about the same price, still have a Chinese piece of junk, and at least it won't data harvest and fill up a third of the display with ads. The best part about returning this horrible pile of refuse is that now I get to deal with UPS, another company where the leadership has a combined IQ of 6.\\n\",\n",

By me having a prime and Fire Stick account, set up was automated.  The automation worked flawlessly in my case.  That alone amazed and impressed me.  I added a Samsung Sound Bar to the Fire TV and now this a great entertainment area.  Colors are beautiful on this set, like I said earlier I didn't make but a few minor adjustments to this set.The Fire Stick works flawlessly and it is a lot smoother than the 4k separate Fire Sticks.  The built in Fire Stick integrated perfectly to my Arlo Security System and do not let me forget about Alexa she is working amazingly well with the built in Fire Stick on the Fire TV.I really would purchase another Amazon brand Fire TV with the built in Fire Stick again at this point.  I only had the Fire TV since October 2021.  By being a Prime member for many years now, Amazon offer prime member early deals before the TV were release forsale to the public.  The deal that were offer were a great saving for prime members.I just hope that the Fire TV last many years as my Sony and Samsung have.  Those sets were and still is trouble free.  Only time will tell the longevity of Amazon Fire TV w/Built in Fire stick.\\n\",\n",

The biggest issue I see from people are the complaints about the annoying LED light on the front of the TV that always stays on.  Here's a tip:  Just cover it up with either dimming tape or sit something in front of it.  I sat a small DVD player (remember those?) in front of the TV and pushed it up against the TV so that the light is completely blocked.  All functions of the remote still work except in order to shut the TV off, you just have to hold down the blue Alexa button and tell Alexa to shut the TV off.  You can press the same blue Alexa button and it automatically turns it back on.  You really don't even need the power button on the remote.  If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive TV that is even suitable as the main TV in your living room, look no further.\\n\",\n",

We have excellent WiFi here... 180Mbps down and 150 up in our Great Room... and the throughput to computers and phones is 400Mbps, so it's not the network or speed.  Even with the TV 10ft closer to the WiFi Access Point, the TV signal is not that great, and is still not 100% reliable although much better than on the back patio.  On the patio where we want to sit the TV... I can test 45Mbps down/up on my laptop.  This should be very ample speed, but the WiFi card/receiver/antenna in the TV is apparently not of sufficient quality to acquire the better WiFi speeds.The sound is also muffled... tried adjusting it to no avail.Very disappointed and was expecting better performance with the WiFi.\\n\",\n",

It arrived earlier than the date given by 4 days, and the delivery person put it right down in my living room I was beyond pleased.  I had it set up in no time and I am one happy senior camper.

Usually Amazon Prime delivers during the afternoon around my area so when I got a notification that morning that it was already delivered at six am surprised me as I found it sitting in front of the doorstep. So it was delivered early as it was suppose to be delivered on Saturday but I got it a day earlier. Overall, setting this up was pretty simple, I booted it up and apparently it needed to update right out of the box so I let it update which took about an hour but shortly after that getting all the apps that I use onto the TV was pretty simple as well. The picture quality on the TV is pretty good, I think a soundbar isn't really needed as the sound the TV provides is pretty good as well.I have a PS5 and so gaming on this TV is pretty cool. It even switches to a gaming type mode of picture quality when you switch to the HDMI that has your PS5 Connected to which is unique because on my PlayStation 5 when I used on that TV it didn't do that at all and I would have to manually do it from the TV but with the Amazon Fire TV I didn't have to configure anything at all as it switched to that kind of pictured mode. My only problem, which it can be the TV itself or the HDMI Cable I have connected to the Cable Box is that at times it would flicker for a second and then stop, but do it again after awhile. When I'm always gaming, this is never an issue though so it could just be the HDMI Cable that could use a replacement. Overall, I am pretty much glad I got this at such an amazing price and maybe I'll use this TV for a good while.\\n\",\n",

When buzz started about a $99 tv for prime day I was ready. I found the tv on pre sale and started watching the deal. When it went live at 8:00 am day two of prime day……I was headed to an appointment!!  I pulled over, clicked this baby into the cart, and in 6 minutes, the deal was claimed, but I got mine!  The whole idea of having a tv shipped was making me a bit crazy. I mean, cmon, we’ve all seen some pretty haggard boxes showing up on our door steps that went thru the shipping process. This box arrived as if they had just picked it off the tv assembly line and dropped it on my porch. Perfection!  Next, unboxing, assembly and setup.  Easy, easy and easy!  Opened box, attach legs, place in room, plug in!  This 4K tv has a great picture. Menu looks exactly like the fire stick I’m running on the den tv, and, it has pretty decent sound with no sound bar attached. Perfect for the bedroom. Even at regular price, it’s a great deal. But when you apply a $10.00 gift card, and $5 bucks of credit card points…….Best $84 bucks I’ve spent in quite awhile. Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nWe hunted for a tv for months, but didn\\'t want a smart tv.  Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43\" was the perfect size for our room).We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, \"no, no, okay.\" Manual only; we didn\\'t want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don\\'t know why anyone complained it couldn\\'t go loud enough.  The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of \"action/motion smoothness\" but didn\\'t really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the  box.A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy!  Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy.  Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected.  When  you figure in the price, it\\'s really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn\\'t even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound.  1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven\\'t tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven\\'t tried it.) We\\'re really happyas is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThis is a review of the Amazon Fire TV 55\" 4-Series 4K UHD Smart TV. I\\'ve never owned an expensive TV so I could not give such a comparison. And I\\'m a 2-decade-long cord-cutter, BTW! This unit was bought to replace a (non-smart) Sceptre 50\" 1080p bought in 2014 w/a gazillion hours of use; it had a center stand that swiveled. Nowadays these all come with wide spread legs, which is fine, except that it went over my bedroom table, so I bought the stand (B078MBL6KM).Compared to my former TV this has a clearer and sharper picture, and the audio is a big improvement; this has as bit of bass to it. The TV is lightweight; the connections easy to access. But this is not a typical TV where you turn it on and a live channel appears. This is a media computer with a big screen; I like it! I still have a Fire TV Box (2015); this is much better, but functions the same as the Fire TV Box & Stick.I plug in a USB with MP4 files on it, and it plays them under the Media Input, just like if you used a Media PC, which I have connected below it, to Input HDMI-1, but I may not need to use it anymore. With my Fire Tablet on the night stand next to a smartphone, my shopping and quick search needs are met therein.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nMounting it was extremely easy (although I had my dad do it but he’s got all the carpenter’s tools; a stud finder, power drill and socket wrench set will do that). It’s very light for such a large TV but still pretty sturdy and well designed. It has more HDMI ports than most newer TVs out there, big bonus, as well as optical, USB and Ethernet ports.As far as interface, super easy. I used Roku previously and this was not a huge leap. It connected to my Amazon account automatically and I had my three other streaming accounts hooked up in minutes. But it walks you though the usual setup the first time you power it on: language, all first time updates, a choice of apps or TV channel searching (can be skipped then added later) and then goes directly to the Home Screen where you can add what you like. Very simple and easy to understand. It doesn’t take forever to load when switching apps; it almost instantly just takes you to where you left off when switching between them. Absolutely love that feature. It does power down when idling on still screens too long but waking and resuming is quick too. The picture and audio settings are a breeze to tweak through the remote. The sound and picture are just right as well; the sound is crisp and balanced and the picture has easy defaults or can be customized. I always turn down the backlight because they always tend to be brighter than i like but it was simple to find. Switching to inputs or new apps is one-button; you don’t have to keep backing out to get to another quickly.Honestly very impressed. I don’t need a lot of bells and whistles so I like when the things I do need a TV for are simple and seamless. It’s super easy switching between TV and three gaming consoles. Easy to add a HTML splitter and take advantage of more devices on one input if needed.I’m the first person I know to get a Fire TV so it was a gamble, but it definitely paid off. Very worthwhile to get a mount if you feel confident installing it (you can always pay for installation if not). It’s a great TV to take advantage of newer game consoles. Personally, the Omni series had a bunch of stuff I didn’t need, so if you just need a TV for streaming and gaming, the 4-Series doesn’t disappoint.On a side note, I saw some reviews about a ‘bright blue standby light’ that no longer exists as of this review. It’s a softer whitish light and not very bright. If a standby light does bother you at night, invest in black electrical tape. I’m not sure why people drop so many stars over minor personal issues. If you do happen to have pet peeves about electronics, it’s always best to research before you buy! And yes, companies do read reviews and see customer suggestions so nitpick away to improve their products. Either way, I have no complaints on what I ended up with.\\n',\n",

Cant forget the elephant in the room which is alexa and compatibility, the remotes alexa is nice but, it pairs fairly well with the echo dot (I have one) They truly go hand in hand making for a nearly hands free experience (if you want hands-free, check out the slightly more expensive Omni variant of this TV)There is...one thing however. My TV picture? Yeah, it wobbles.I thought it was normal or part of my shows, I’d be watching The Boys (not a sponsor, just coincidentally watching an Amazon show on an Amazon TV lmao) and I notice that, fairly rarely, the background will shake for one or two seconds. Now honestly, do I care? No, because it’s so rare and quick that I don’t notice, but I wanted to point it out because that’s what proper reviews do. So I couldn’t quite find how to fix it but hopefully I can find a fix for it somewhere down the line.Other than that, the TV is absolutely worth it, the amazing quality, banging sound, alexa compatibility, and more make this a great choice!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nTwo days in and biggest problem was modifying 38\" wide TV cabinet to fit 55\" TV. Since TV is only 3.5\" wide this just needed a C-notch. 25 lb TV is much easier to manometer than 85 lb in guest bedroom. Mounted on slides so easy to get to rear panel.RCA 5 digit remote (has numeric keypad, can control 3 devices) code was 12434, same as many, many other smart TVs. 4-digit (Philips) 2851.Should pay for self in about 4 months since now streaming & OTA (102 channels) ( dash on remote does not work but TV understands whole numbers).Not the greatest status symbol but also \"value priced\". White box on top is for Bose system so TV sound is unimportant.Was hand delivered to my door by careful driver who called first. Only question now is longevity but makes captions easier to read than previous 43\" TV..ps I do not find the blue light on the bottom objectionable. If I did, a small piece of electrical tape should block.Update: since I receive over 100 OTA channels, I need a numeric keypad. The problem I found is that the Fire TV apparently has a two stage turn off. The first only lasts for about five minutes, then \"changes\" and needs a different signal.. The codes above cannot turn the TV back on once it reaches the second stage.The RCA cannot handle this but the three device Philips SRP3219G/27  remote allows multiple codes. 2851 can handle everything except the second stage turn on. Codes 1091 or 6091 can provide the turn on but not much else so I programmed the \"TV\" button to 2851 and the \"STR\" for 1091. That works for me.pps the lighter color Philips remotes are easier to see the buttons.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThe TV is really nice, looks great and integrates with Roku speakers.But my primary usecase is using Xfinity cable service.  The default when powered on is Amazon.I would prefer it to remember the last HDMI selection and start with that.  As it is now, I have to use two remotes... The Fire remote to change SOURCE (Which is in settings and not on a button); then use the Xfinity remote to do other things.  I get it... This is an attempt to move everyone over to Amazon by default, but I can't do that just now.  It would be nice if it remembered the HDMI selection between power cycles.I have not tried controlling it with voice via Alexa.  Perhaps I can tell her to change to HDMI1?  That would be better, but still not as nice as remembering the selection.Update (07/06/22):  The voice control on the remote WILL change the HDMI Source.  That makes changing source much easier. Also, Depending on how you turn it on (from the included Fire Remote or a paired Xfinity remote) it will change source to the the last setting.  If I turned it off with the XFinity remote, then use it to turn it back on... It will come on to the Fire home page, but a few moments later, change the the previous HDMI (and sound) settings.  I'm upping my rating to 5 Star.I was really enjoying the 4K resolution, and noting that the picture is really goodAlso, works with my Roku soundbar.  That makes two streaming options and cable as my sources.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI was a bit concerned when I purchased this TV. I wasn’t sure about the quality. But, my top of the line flat screen that I had for 18 years died. I needed a TV and knew I wanted a smart TV. This was on sale. It had all the features I wanted. I would have like to have purchased a bigger size, but with bigger sizes comes bigger prices. I bought the 55”. My 15 year old grandson helped me set everything up. It’s been easy enough to use. I’m very happy with the TV and would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a new TV. It arrived in 2 days. I’m a prime member, so it was free shipping. It arrived in a big Amazon truck; I have never seen a truck delivering that big before. Two men brought it carefully to my door. We had it set up and ready to go in 5 minutes! So far, I’m loving it!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI have used the Fire sticks for a few years on smaller TV's with no problem and now I wanted a bigger TV so I decided to stick with the Fire, but I didn't know that Amazon had it's own tv brand, I thought I would give it a try since I had no problems with other Amazon brand stuff. Just as with Fire stick set up is easy. Picture is great, I had to play around with the sound settings, but I got it worked out to my personal preferences. I had price compared a bit and feel like the price was very good, I might could have got a 55 inch TV for a bit cheaper but I felt comfortable buying the Amazon brand knowing that if I had a problem they would be there to help me, returns and such. Had it about a month now, no problems, I enjoy it very much and spent less than $400 on a 55 inch TV, so 5 stars\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAmazon's FireTV is such an easy Smart TV to use, for both cable households and cable cutters. The apps work so seemlessly  with the TV, which makes streaming a much easier process. If you don't have cable, your broadcast antenna works so efficiently with the TV, you won't miss having cable. The TV reads the broadcast signal and gives you a channel guide that is nearly perfect. The Alexa integration is simple and the voice button on the remote makes it easy to change to any TV channel or app. You'll love this TV!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nShipped fast and arrived on my doorstep In great shape!  Thin and light!  Easy to setup and use. Dedicated remote buttons for my top 4 streaming apps. TV also supports Apple TV and Plex!  For the first time, I’ve unplugged my Apple TV and am using just the TV remote alone. It seems Amazon has dialed back the advertising and I don’t feel like I’m being upsold every time I watch a show.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI think I really like this TV especially since my local CBS affiliate's owner and Dish Network have removed CBS for over 2 months in a carriage dispute.  I can now get my local CBS through my Paramount+ subscription which is awesome.  The TV was easy to set up after all the updating and downloading.  For the money this is a good deal.  The downside?  We got this TV for our bedroom and when it is off there is this really annoying bright standby light on the TV.  Otherwise, I would probably give this review 5 stars.  I will be putting a piece of black tape over the light which is kind of a sad thing to do on a new purchase.\\n\",\n",

After an extensive web search, we found the solution: while show is playing, pause and hit settings button on remote. Go to picture, advanced settings, and action smoothing and reduce it. We just figured this out and it seems much better... Time will tell and if it ends up not being the resolution to our issue, I'll update this!\\n\",\n",

It had so much more than I had imagined built into the TV. Besides everything that you might expect, be prepared, it has so much more.They offer you apps at no extra charge. Good ones! Sure, they have the premium ones that you pay for, if you want them but the selection of free apps is incredibleThe remote is child’s play. Even I didn’t have a hard time with it! The picture quality… Unsurpassed. I can’t complain about anything (except that maybe it’s hard to tear myself away from the set now! Lol)You truly can’t go wrong with this TV.Oh, and I was blown over by the price as well. I even asked the informed techs in my family…what is wrong with this and their answer was that with Amazons return policy, I couldn’t go wrong with talking the leap. They were right. Great purchase.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nUpdated review***As promised I received my replacement tv 2 days later. Delivery was GREAT the 2nd time around of course the service wasn’t through UPS this time. I set my tv up which didn’t take long at all. Very simple I actually never even looked at the instructions manual for reference. Picture was nice and clear. Sound was ok. I typically have Soundbars connected to all my TVs so I’m used to it sounding a bit more higher quality. Absolutely recommend purchasing this tv especially at the $99 price I paid. My only issue would be who they setup delivery with. If it’s through UPS just prepare yourself to return itWell let’s start by saying I knew something was going to go wrong. When I purchase delicate items I prefer FedEx to deliver. When I noticed that it was being shipped through UPS I automatically assumed it would arrive shattered. To my surprise the screen was intact. BUT…yes there’s always a but. When I plugged the tv in I immediately noticed the screen was completely black with lines going through it. Almost looked as if there was water damage. I called Amazon and spoke to an agent who was very apologetic and arranged to have UPS come pick up the tv. He also shipped out a replacement tv. Hopefully the next review I write is solely about the tv itself.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, \"how much did you pay for this again?\" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don\\'t understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations.  So glad I got it!\\n',\n",

       " '\\nI took advantage of prime day and bought the 55\" version of this TV.  I was replacing a 37\" on the wall.  The installation was easy, and when first starting up (I associated it with my amazon account when purchasing) it auto-updated a couple of times and kept restarting to do it, but after about 15 minutes was up and ready to go.  I played with some of the built in apps and guide and they are pretty cool and work well.  I tried airplay from both my iphone and Mac and it works great -- just like an apple TV.  I use Tivo, and to get the Tivo remote to work with this TV, I had to use \"Element\" as the brand (so to those reviews where they said the TV is not in the list of other products, use \"Element.\"  One review complained that the TV always started on the homescreen when turned on, and not the video input they want (HDMI1)  You can set it the way you want, but you have to go into settings, picture, power-on options and you can choose home or use last video input used.  This way it stays on the cable box etc.  The Alexa feature is cool and works, but I really don\\'t use it.  One of the reviews complained about not using standard screw sizes for wall mount.. This is not valid.. I ran into a similar issue as I was going from a 37\" to a 55\" and the screw sizes for these size sets are different where one uses M4 vs M6 screws...  Any wall mount kit will have the correct size screws included with it, and even if you are replacing an older smaller set like me and have lost the rest of the screws, I went to home depot and they sell them there as M6 in various lengths...  TV has only been installed and working 24 hours, but so far well worth the money!\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nAmazing for the price.  Definitely get what you pay for.  The TV TCL brand recognized my wifi immediately during boot up and I didn't even have to put in a password...same with it registering my Amazon...it already knew me....weird...I didn't have to put in an email or password...just a pin for parental setup.  The fire app software on the TV or Smart TV feature is pretty nice and easy to use...and surprisingly fast...ish..only a true gamer would notice any lag.  The remote has quick buttons to Hulu Amazon Prime Video and Disney, very nice and looks like a longer flatter roku remote...not bad.  The backside has 3 hdmi ports and an ethernet port and some other stuff.  If front facing the TV those ports are on the right and the power is by itself on the left.  For my basement...the normal person is about 15 ft away...this TV is perfect for this distance.  To get to other inputs...hit settings button on remote and on the screen you will see inputs.  Very easy: Didn't even have to use instructions.\\n\",\n",

It’s fairly lightweight and was simple to hang using it’s standard VESA mounting system.We use Fire TV sticks in all of our other TVs and this unit works the exact same way without the need for extra hardware. Very fast if connected to a good WiFi connection and the controls are quite responsive. It was simple to set up. Plug it in, connect to WiFi, log into to your Amazon account, wait for your apps download, start watching TV.It has a fantastic picture with good brightness and picture settings to make any necessary adjustments for your particular viewing situation. We have this TV mounted on the wall under a 50x20 covered patio and can see the picture well from any part of the patio in any outside lighting conditions.If I need another TV anywhere else in my house, I will definitely be buying another on of these.\\n',\n",

That is, if you don't want to connect it to a sound source beyond the TV.  I had no luck trying to connect this TV to my Onkyo receiver and speakers, either through the ARC output or the optical output.  I tried everything but nothing came out.  My system works fine with my old Phillips TV through a coax cable and still did when I reconnected it.  Customer service couldn't help either so I had no choice but to return the TV reluctantly.  I have 5 times the investment in my home theatre than I do the TV and I will not give that up.  Still it is a really good TV on its own.\\n\",\n",

The vibrancy of the colors is crystal clear.  The price was what fit my budget and for the money, got more than expected.  The HDMI slots also allow set up of my favorites, and within in minutes, everyone was watching movies and popcorn night.

       " '\\nFor the price this TV is a steal!I love how you can ask alexa to check on status package and it shows all your packages being delivered or track status.This Tv replaced one of my 4k tvs that was starting to show its age. As far as picture quality for the price it’s pretty good. HDR10 looks amazing and very clear and I found it to be more than bright enough. Yes You can find better TVs with brighter HDR and Dolby Vision but you will pay twice as much. I have 4 other TVs with Dolby vision and the difference isn’t a deal breaker for me.If you need a replacement TV and can live without Dolby Vision you will not be disappointed with this one. HDR and HLG is more than enough for this TV.5 Star recommendation\\n',\n",

Most of this time was waiting for the App.to install. If you have Amazon Prime? The TV programs itself using your current Amazon Prime Account. So far I’m 100% satisfied.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nReally solid television for the price. I got the 50\" for $320 and it\\'s really an impressive value proposition. I\\'ve got a Samsung Q70 in the living room and a Vizio M Quantum in my bedroom and this compares favorably to both of those considerably more pricey TV\\'s. Smart features are well organized and easily accessible, voice integration with Alexa devices works well, display quality is about an 7-8/10 and more than adequate for all but the most picky viewers. Biggest negative is the sound, which is tinny and underwhelming. I generally hook up TV\\'s to sound bars so I don\\'t put much value on built-in speakers but, being in a guest room, this one isn\\'t getting a sound bar setup and it\\'s noticeable just how hollow the sound is compared to even a cheap sound bar. One notable plus on this TV is it\\'s extremely lightweight; I didn\\'t put it on a scale but it weighed probably half of what the older 42\" TV it replaced did.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nSo far I'm am enjoying everything about this TV!! The 4K UHD is very nice, I would say it's competitive against other makers that offer 4K UHD but at a much more affordable price in my opinion. The sound settings are also a nice touch with different EQs available to pick. I will say you need to tweak the display imaging settings to get the true 4K out of it but it the end I'm loving my new TV!\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nSo far this TV has been well worth the money.  I've only had it for about two weeks at present, but it's been working perfectly.  Plenty of HDMI inputs, and the USB port is great for a 4TB HDD on which I have a bunch of TV shows and movies in mp4 format.  The WiFi connection is strong and adding any apps I needed/wanted was a cinch, as was signing into them, which is made much easier by using a computer.The picture is great, and streaming in 4k looks fantastic, though 1080p and 720p items look great as well, the latter two of which are the resolutions of the aforementioned movies and TV shows on the HDD, respectively.  I also tried wirelessly casting from both my M1 Mac Mini and my AM02 Windows mini pc, and it worked flawlessly.  It has all of the expected settings to adjust the picture and sound.The sound, while not great, is adequate, though I wouldn't expect sound from little speakers to be spectacular anyway.  It would be easy to add better sound via speakers connected to the optical port, but for now the built in sound is good enough.My only real complaint thus far is with the built in Media Player.  I have my movies and TV shows sorted by folders and subfolders on the HDD, and the media player shows every folder on the disk in one big group.  In my case that's over 1000 folders.  I can sort them alphabetically, but if I want to watch something near the end of the alphabet, such as 'V for Vendetta', I have to scroll through 1000+ folders to get to it, which takes upwards of five minutes or more, and is tedious and extremely annoying.  Luckily, I found MX Player, which is an app available for the TV that sorts the folders as intended, such as clicking into the 'Films' folder, then the 'V' folder, then the title folder, then clicking the mp4 to play it.  MX Player also has a lot of useful settings adjustments for playback.  Either Amazon should revamp their Media Player app or include an already installed alternative like MX Player.All in all this has been a great TV so far.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive 4k TV.  No, it's not a $1000 TV with all the bells and whistles and the best of everything, but for the price it's a great choice.\\n\",\n",

It's really nice not having to mess with the firestick separately. I love that it's one remote that i didn't have to sync to the tv and the stick. The picture is really clear and the TV is fairly slim, it mounted easily to our wall mount. Our old TV stopped turning on and we ordered this one because, a) the price was hard to beat for a 55 inch tv and b) we were able to make Amazon's monthly payments instead. We weren't expecting to need a new TV and honestly didn't have the money saved so being able to use the payments option was crucial. Also yes I know we could of waited til we had the money saved but after a crap day at work its nice to be able to unwind with a favorite movie or a fun video game, don't judge me to hard. If you've been thinking about trying one of these TV's out I do reccomend them so far.\\n\",\n",

Occasionally it forgets what episode I was on so I have to remember where I was before each pause in case I don’t get back before it times out and I have to go searching to continue. There’s an app supposed to fix this but I haven’t downloaded yet. This TV seems unaware of the apps I pay for and have downloaded and is always suggesting more apps I can pay for but don’t want. I would prefer that it knows what I want to watch and list those separately instead of mixed in with everything possible to watch. This TV doesn’t turn off. It always goes to sleep mode.

Because I have lots of DVDs and Blu-rays I upgraded my Blu-ray player too. The Fire TV requires that your extensions be connected via HDMI connection. The television defaults to your SMART features  every time you power on the television. You’ll find the apps you use most often and the recent shows/movies you’ve watched on your Home screen. If you already have a Fire Stick, your preferences sync for you making the transition from the stick to the tv easy.  The picture is bright and crisp. The sound is satisfactory. If you want the full “movie” experience, I suggest you buy a sound bar.

I waited for prime day to buy it at what I thought was the lowest price, but the next day the price was lower.  I requested that I should be charged the lowest price since I bought it on during prime day.  They said they had no knowledge of it being offered at such a low price.  I was so upset that I was going to not accept the television and have it sent back.

It was easy to attach with the vesa holes and setting it all up was easy. The TV itself was easy for me to move around, attach the stand, etc., and I purchased the 50 inch model. The pictures clarity is amazing. My old tv was a 2009 Samsung and it's night and day. That's how much of an improvement the Amazon Fire TV is compared to an older name brand TV. I did purchase a sound bar and literally between the sound bar and the TV, I felt like I was watching a movie in a theater. I don't post reviews very often but the TV has impressed me. I do have cable hook up and may end that once my contract expires and the interface on the tv switching between cable or the smart tv options is the same as the fire stick I have on a smaller bedroom tv. Again, I was able to take out if the box, attach to a tv stand and place on a table with no assistance in probably less that 10 minutes. The 50 inch tv weighs around 25 lbs but it's not awkward to handle. Well worth your while to give the tv a try as opposed to more expensive name brand models.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nPrime day rolled around and this was too good to pass up.  We were skeptical about quality, but very pleased with the overall quality of sound and picture out of this TV.Plenty of inputs although we are only using the coax for antenna.  Hooked right up to our network, updated software, and was working right away.  Like the Amazon OS better than our older Roku unit because of better apps and internet browser access.  The remote has easy access to antenna tv, volume, and channel changing.  We don’t use the other presets, but they’re not in the way.  If it holds up, this is a winner of a purchase for us.\\n',\n",

TV was 289. I got a further 150 discount by using Amazon credit card gift card. This 55\" beauty cost me $139.  I made out like a bandit. Set up was seamless to my Amazon acct. I had a firestick previously... Took 35 MIns. The picture is sharp vivid and crystal clear... Images jump off the screen. The sound quality was great I had seen so.e reviews  stating sound was not good... It was fine and I\\'m ad I did not get the sound bar because this TV has Bluetooth and it connected direct to my music system via blue tooth for the boost when playing music videos or for movie effect. BEST PURCHASE EVER! I LOVE MY FIRE TV. If I could give 6 stars I would.... Just buy it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThis is our 1st ever “Smart TV” and the FireTV was worth the 2 week lead time. Manufactured by Pioneer who’s TV Displays back in day were top notch .Very very easy to setup and what a joy to use. My only gripe is no number keypad for normal off the air DTV. You must change channels through the TV Guide (yes, I’m that old).TV sound is good enough for this Audiophile. The AmazonHD Music App and playback via an external DAC via the Optical output is another plus.Will there be bigger versions next year (say 75” - 80”) ?\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIt took me about 40 minutes, start to finish, including my connections and apps. I did it by myself. I used a Phillips screwdriver and attached the legs. I connected my Roku and sound bar. Installed the included AAA batteries into the remote. The TV started right up, with no issues whatsoever. So far so good. From the home screen, I was able to adjust my TV picture and sound. I turned off the TV speakers and set my soundbar settings. I don\\'t do any gaming. This is not a \"fancy\" TV. But it\\'s exactly what I expected and wanted to purchase. I\\'m very pleased with the entire Amazon experience from ordering to delivery!\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI still have to get up and walk to the TV to read texts and notes on screen. The apps close after about 15 minutes so there’s not a pause function except for a short time. Occasionally it forgets what episode I was on so I have to remember where I was before each pause in case I don’t get back before it times out and I have to go searching to continue. There’s an app supposed to fix this but I haven’t downloaded yet. This TV seems unaware of the apps I pay for and have downloaded and is always suggesting more apps I can pay for but don’t want. I would prefer that it knows what I want to watch and list those separately instead of mixed in with everything possible to watch. This TV doesn’t turn off. It always goes to sleep mode. I bought this because it fits on my dresser and only weighs 20 lb so I can move it by myself and don’t have to hang on wall. It’s not very user friendly but overall I’m happy with it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI needed to upgrade the television in my bedroom. I selected the 43 inch Fire TV.  The SMART features available are extensive, and the television has multiple HDMI connections.  Because I have lots of DVDs and Blu-rays I upgraded my Blu-ray player too. The Fire TV requires that your extensions be connected via HDMI connection. The television defaults to your SMART features  every time you power on the television. You’ll find the apps you use most often and the recent shows/movies you’ve watched on your Home screen. If you already have a Fire Stick, your preferences sync for you making the transition from the stick to the tv easy.  The picture is bright and crisp. The sound is satisfactory. If you want the full “movie” experience, I suggest you buy a sound bar. I’m pleased with my purchase, and will consider a bigger screen Fire TV when I need to replace other televisions in my house.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe only thing that I dislike was the price.  I did get this on the first day of prime day.  The next day I received an offer at a more unbelievable price.  When I tried to buy it, I found out that it was sold out and the waiting list was full.  I contacted Amazon and complained.  I waited for prime day to buy it at what I thought was the lowest price, but the next day the price was lower.  I requested that I should be charged the lowest price since I bought it on during prime day.  They said they had no knowledge of it being offered at such a low price.  I was so upset that I was going to not accept the television and have it sent back.  After it arrived I read the special features and I had to admit that it was still a great price for a great product, so I just swallowed my pride and kept it. I have discovered what they mean by a smart tv.  This really is a great television!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI needed a TV for my spare bedroom.  From the reviews, and internet research I chose this model.  It came the day after I ordered it. Easy physical setup. I'm in a wheelchair, and was able to get the TV out of the box, attach the legs, and put it where it goes by myself.  Electronic setup was a breeze; the TV found  signed in to my Wi-Fi network automatically. Once I was signed in, all of my purchased Amazon subscriptions, movies and TV shows were available.Picture and sound quality is quite good. If you're a video/audiophile, this should probably not be your main  kit, but for everyday TV viewing or in your spare bedroom, this unit is perfect.I really like the Alexa/voice control functionality.  It might take you a bit of time to work through all the commands, but you'll figure it out. You need the remote to do voice control, so  don't lose the remote!This is a really good TV, at a great price point. Highly recommended.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nFirst & foremost the sale price WAS amazing,$150 off. Arrived on time, handled with care. No blemishes on the box or TV. Very light weight,can be picked up easily. Very easy to set up especially if you already have an Amazon/Firestick account which I did and my TV was ready to go within 7 min total from turning it on until my account programing was downloaded & ready to watch!!\\n',\n",
       " '\\nLuckily I managed to purchase this TV on sale since I needed to retire my old Toshiba unit in my bedroom.The size works perfect and has great picture quality (better than my 50\" Samsung in living room) and it is highly responsive to remote inputs.Compared to using a Fire TV Stick, this unit operates much faster when making selections and so far has been less problematic than some of my F TV Sticks on other TV\\'s.The Amazon house branded one is even better than the Insignia with Fire TV that my roommate has.I have seen a number of people complain about the light on the bottom of the TV being too bright when it is turned off, but I have not had that issue with mine. So unless you are very sensitive sleeper, I wold not worry about this issue at all.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nVery easy to set up. I was able to attach the legs and hook everything up in maybe 10 minutes. Updated the software and adding apps took about an hour. The Firestick is already incorporated into the tv so there is no need to connect anything there, which I love. The tv already had my Amazon account info so I didn't have to enter anything there, either. Super easy. I also connected my blu ray player and I was ready to go. Moving from app to app or changing to different inputs is also easy and, more importantly, very fast. I also connected my antenna to it and the channels found OTA are also incorporated into the live channel guide that includes all the channels I get on YoutubeTV, too. Kinda nice feature.So far, I love everything about this tv. I will update if necessary.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI am using this tv in my bedroom, I can't believe how good the picture is! Sorry to say but it is better than my 55inch tcl! Lots of stuff to choose from! Thin bessel, crystal clear, I mean crystal clear! And I have the samsung top model! It looks just as good as theirs! You won't be disappointed! I was surprisingly shocked!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIf you\\'re looking for a quality 4K TV with great features and an affordable price, the Amazon Fire TV 43\" 4-Series is a great option. We love the Picture-in-Picture feature that allows you to watch two shows at the same time, and the Dolby Vision HDR delivers stunning picture quality. The only downside is that there are few apps available on the platform compared to other streaming devices. Overall, we think the Amazon Fire TV 43\" 4-Series is a great value for your money.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe TV had free shipping to my home and it arrived quickly on the predicted delivery day.  Unpacked it with a friend helping.  Easily attached a universal stand.  Setup following instructions was quick and simple.  Great sound with several options.  Great picture made better (my opinion) by dropping the Background Saturation from 100 to 90.  Easily transferred my Amazon Fire account over to TV.  Also my Dish TV account worked seamlessly (no set up needed) when I connected to HDMI 4 port.  The remote works well without any delay in operation\\n',\n",
       " '\\nWe lived with a 32\" \"dumb\" TV for years, relying on other devices to provide streaming content. When we decided to upgrade, we found the Amazon Fire TV 50\" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV. The size is perfect for our family of 4, much larger than the old 32\" screen, but not something that overwhelms our space. The picture quality is remarkable, and we run at about 60% backlighting and the picture is still super bright and clear. The TV comes pre-installed with many streaming providers, and setup was a breeze. Many other providers are available for download. I saw a number of reviews that complained of the light when TV is powered down; either Amazon heard this complaint and changed the lighting, or folks are a lot more sensitive to light than we are. The remote is small, yet easy to use. I haven\\'t set up any voice commands, but the remote allows for voice commands. When we first set the system up, once we got the TV connected to wifi, a few downloads took place, the TV integrated with our prime account, and we were up and running in about 15-20 minutes. Since then, not one problem. I don\\'t know why we waited this long to upgrade our viewing experience!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nIt's a nice firetv. I love the fact that I don't need a fire stick because it's basically built in.  I bought the swivel wall mount on here.  That way I can pull it from the wall when I wanna watch something in bed. I'm blind as bat so that's why the weird location by my bed.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nWhen I saw this 43\" Fire TV for 200.00 it was just to good to pass up. It has surpassed all my expectations so far although I have yet to really test the 4k 1080p looks beautiful. After turning the backlight down it only pulls 35 to 40 watts most the time. I run solar off the grid setup so power consumption is important. At the moment I only have good things to say about this product. Though there is one thing to note the inputs are on the right side of the model I received small detail might not matter but every other tv around here they are on the left... Update: I have had the TV about 22 days and Have just experienced the black screen. You have sound but no pictures even with antenna or amazon apps. Turning it off and back on had no effect so I pulled the plug and that seemed to work for no but a bad sign...\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI wanted a larger TV w/o breaking the bank and this Fire TV was/is it!!!  The picture quality is superb, it’s pretty smart, and the delivery was great (w/no problems or package damaging)—great bang for the buck!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI was replacing an older TV that had issues staying connected to the internet. I ordered a smaller Fire TV last year for a guest bedroom and it worked great, so I thought I would order another one.  With the price and the reviews, I was skeptical, but I figured it couldn't be worse than my current TV.  I ordered with Prime.  It came a day early. It was so easy to set up!!  Unpackage, plug in, turn on.  The scary part is that it connected with a nearby fire stick, so when I turned it on, it displayed my name.  I didn't even have to connect it to my wifi.  The remote feels a little flimsy, but works fine.  The picture quality is better than anticipated. No high HD but very clear.  Sound average and decent.  Lastly, as to not have to buy a new TV stand, I had to buy a single platform stand. The legs were wide (i think 3ft apart)\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nSo far so good! Set up was very easy, Great picture, great sound. Excellent value for the money.. I’m very happy with this purchase!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI have to be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I bought this TV. Meaning, I wasn't expecting a great picture, or great sound, or user interface.Boy was I shocked when I set it up! First of all, set-up is a breeze, especially when it's linked to your Amazon account.Next, when I was done setting it up, and was able to watch TV, I was totally impressed! The picture quality is amazing! It almost looks like your watching a live telecast. If you're watching a SD channel, it looks like it's upconverted to either 1080p or 4K. Like I said, I was completely surprised and impressed.The user interface is very easy to understand and navigate.Simply put, this is an excellent 4k tv and I highly recommend it!!!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI was kinda scared to buy this TV at first cause of some of the other reviews. Especially with it being shipped. I didn’t want to receive it broken. The TV was in perfect shape, no problems. Set up was easy. The layout of the TV is easy to operate. I like this TV more than my Vizio. I wish the remote had numbers on it, it has the channel up and down buttons.I did buy a roku for it only cause I have spectrum for TV service and this TV doesn’t have the app to download yet. I also bought an antenna to get local channels.The picture quality is perfect A+++I do recommend this TV to anyone who wants to save money, and wants an easy set up.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe camera for our ring doorbell didn’t pop up on it even with the setting for that being turned off my son would be much happier. I even went to deregister it from my account and it said “are you sure, by deregistering this item it will make a lot of features on it unusable. Other then that issue everything works fine, but in all honesty I think it’s going back cuz of the Alexa features not being able to be turned off. It gives you the option but it still announces  and stops your program you’re watching or game you’re playing to announce any movement from a person standing on your porch or a bird flying by. So yea it’s probably going back and we’ll get him a tv from Walmart or someplace else.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nNot that I know a lot about today's technology, but I found this tv to be everything I need. Also bought an Amazon smart plug so I can have Alexa turn the livingroom light on and off with my remote. See? Even old people can learn new things.\\n\",\n",

I’m not used to sitting around but sometimes you have to listen to your body.This TV is the perfect size for my bedroom in my Mom’s house.

I feel like I’m in a movie theater.Thank you Amazon for putting this on sale!! Never thought I would spend money on a massive television but then I never thought I’d spend my 60’s sitting on my behind.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI am so pleased with not only the television, but the Fire TV platform. I've used a Fire Stick in the past, but this television takes it to the next level.  It's easy to operate, I have a great selection of things to watch - even before paying for any streaming services. I dumped my cable and am saving $120 a month now and I can even get local news channels in the interface!! Great tv - great performance.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI bought the TV during a special being ran as 1: An upgrade and 2: To replace a TV that broke.  First, I like that I can make payments with opening a credit card or entering one of those interesting financing schemes that everyone wants to introduce.  As for the TV itself, the picture quality is fine, and it was very easy to set up.  Just connect it to the internet and it will handle the rest.  For those concerned about Alexa, it is off by default.  As this is my only Alexa device, I won’t be using it.  Most popular streaming services are available on the TV.  If you have a Fire Stick, this is not much different.  As for gaming, I have a PS3 and PS4 connected (there are four HDMI 2.0 port with one being eArc) and the quality has been good for me.  I have not experienced any lag on the screen.  The display is 60Hz.  Some of the text may have a slight blur on the edges but not enough to cause issues in my opinion.  I only noticed it when the console was updating.  The remote is simple and it is Bluetooth, which I also paired a set of headphones for listening (I live in an apartment). So far, this is a great TV.Downsides?  The Fire TV app on iPhone, unless I haven’t found a way yet, does not allow to add apps to the TV from anywhere like Roku.  My biggest gripe has nothing to do with the TV but how it was delivered.  Amazon sent this package through USPS, which Amazon notified me that my package was left in the mailbox (yeah, ok. Lol).  USPS said that the package could not be left because no one was home and there was no secure place to leave it. I assumed I would have to make a trip to the post office.  Apparently, someone thought leaving a 55 inch television right next to the entrance door of an apartment building was a great idea.  No way anyone was going to steal it.  I’m glad no one stole it and it wasn’t damaged.  I’m still tinkering around with it and will update.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI am IN LOVE with this TV! I bought this to replace my old Roku TV and it is a million times better! As soon as I plugged this in and turned it on it connected to my Alexa and signed me into my Amazon account. It is super fast, the picture is a 10/10, and it has voice controls which I love. Super easy to navigate different apps. I'm thinking about buying another one that is larger just to replace the Phillips TV I have in my living room because I love it so much.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nThe tv was a last minute replacement to a 50in tv for our bedroom. We accidentally cracked the screen while moving it. The Amazon 55” came within 24 hours and we had it up by the evening. The mounting holes on the back of the tv are definitely a little awkward and requires a mount that has some flexibility for installation.As for picture quality the blacks aren’t the blackest but it’ll do for a bedroom tv. It looks good and works well. Idk if I’d use this tv for a home theater like experience. You’d probably be better off going for something of a better quality and more money.I like being able to ask my Amazon echo to turn if off if I leave the the room. I didn’t have to do any kind of set up to get that feature to work.So far so good.\\n',\n",

Ultimately, I loved the reviews and specs on this TV and purchased it. You will not be disappointed. The clarity of the TV is fabulous. The ease of setting it up (putting together and getting apps loaded on it) was a pleasant surprise. We mounted it on the wall and couldn't be happier. I love being able to stream any app I want and my Amazon account it integrated, making it a breeze for prime movies/tv. We have a brand new Vizio and I like my Fire TV better, so that says something!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nBought this on a wim for a good deal 55\" under $300 around the holidays. Wouldn\\'t buy again, wouldn\\'t suggest buying. The smart and alexa features are extremely intrusive, no way to disable them. Had to block the MAC address from my WiFi because of the TV trying to reconnect...Additionally the volume controls just randomly stop working constantly requiring a restart  of the tv. Other than that, the video quality is pretty great.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAmazon fire is better than my former Roku as a streaming interface. The system is not smart enough to know that you have a subscription to Discovery + and starts you on a trial.The sound is good enough that we no longer need a soundbar.The screen is reflective of windows and light sources to the point that we looked at buying blinds. The problem is worse as the viewing angle increases.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI bought this during Amazon\\'s recent Lightening Deal, couldn\\'t resist!  Got it today and easily set it up (although I wish I didn\\'t have to install all the apps and sign in again with password, it would be cool if it could just grab that info from my other Fire Stick setups).  Once everything was set up, it is easy to use.  Big plus is it is easy to switch between my Directv input and the Amazon Fire TV.  I just have to say \"HDMIx\" into the microphone to switch, or just wait 30 seconds and it will switch automatically.  I will update this if there are any problems down the road, but so far so good!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThis could have been a great TV, but I'll never know because right out of the box it refused to connect to my home Wi-Fi. I literally tried fixing the issue for DAYS but to no avail. Assuming I must have received a defective TV, I ordered a replacement. But no, it wasn't a fluke. The SAME issue happened with the second one. So while the TV technically worked, I was never able to get beyond initial setup due to its inability to connect to Wi-Fi.It also seems impossible to use a soundbar with it. I tried TWO different soundbars of different brands. I connected one using an optical cable, then tried a second using HDMI ARC. On both occasions the TV insisted on playing back sound from its own speakers in addition to the sound coming from the soundbar. This is DESPITE my having turned off the TV speakers from the settings menu. And then double and triple checking just to be sure. The settings absolutely confirm the speakers are off, and yet they are not. So it creates this double audio overlap that is out of sync and unfixable. And intolerable.In my complete frustration I decided to just go ahead and spend an extra $200 on a Sony TV. My mental health was worth the investment. And what do you know? The Sony connected IMMEDIATELY to my wifi. It didn't even hesitate. It also had no issues at all with my soundbar. I didn't even have to go into the settings just to make it work. Just plug and play. Not hope and pray.There's no excuse for why I had these issues on TWO of these TVs. I don't care how cheap or expensive something is, I at least expect it to perform as promised. Instead what I received was a nightmare packaged up in a TV-shaped box where it was ready to take my soul and every ounce of patience I had. It's a shame. Because I had high hopes for this TV, and it seemed to be an amazing value.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nBought this TV during the Prime day live event for $99.00. This was a great investment for the money. The setup was easy. The smart features work well and the picture quality is excellent. There are plenty of inputs for external devices which can be seen in the product details. I have mine connected to an broadcast antenna mounted in the attic and the reception is good. Naturally reception would be different for everyone and dependent on the distance of the TV antenna to the television station broadcast towers. If I ever need another TV I would probably purchase again even at the current price listed on Amazon.\\n',\n",

       " '리뷰': ['\\nI\\'m happy and impressed with it.TV came well packaged and was easy to set up. Which is to be expected as Amazon is just slapping their FireTV OS guts and some branding on some TVs. But they still managed to get that Amazon feel across in the design and the accessories. I will say it would\\'ve been nice if they included an ethernet cable but I guess those saved pennies help their space program or something. Everything you need to get started is there with that minimalist Amazon appeal though. I was unpackaged, plugged in, and powered on in minutes.Set up was a breeze after waiting for an update to download and install. If you\\'re familiar with any of the Fire TV Sticks or other Amazon devices, everything here is familiar. I\\'m neck deep in the Amazon environment from Recast to Fire Sticks so this was an easy choice to take a flyer on. And yes, Recast works on this TV. So to the dozens of us that use it, worry not. The new Fire remote is handy and adds the extra stuff you need for full control of a TV while still being simple. Settings, channel up and down, Live TV, etc. are all there. I\\'m not the biggest fan of branded app buttons at the bottom of the remote as things go away and get renamed, but the more buttons the merrier. I\\'m sure they can be rebound to other apps.The introductory price of the 50\" was too good to pass up. But I will say all the regular prices are just high enough to not be complete bargains. I imagine modest discounts will come occasionally and will be well worth considering. And to be fair, these aren\\'t bare minimum or cheap TVs. You get some real bang for your buck. Above average picture quality and honestly the best \"smart\" integration I\\'ve seen in a TV. I know they added one \"premium\" feature of Dolby Vision to the two largest options of the OMNI series but I do wish they would\\'ve made a model with a few more bells and whistles. Especially ones geared towards \"gamers\" and their consoles. 120hz, VRR, stuff like that. Would\\'ve been a riskier business choice I suppose. I was shopping for a bedroom and 65\" or 75\" was just too big and DV wasn\\'t enough of an allure. But for an introductory line of TVs I think they struck the right balance of options in the two lines and prices points.

       "  '\\nI\\'m happy and impressed with it.TV came well packaged and was easy to set up. Which is to be expected as Amazon is just slapping their FireTV OS guts and some branding on some TVs. But they still managed to get that Amazon feel across in the design and the accessories. I will say it would\\'ve been nice if they included an ethernet cable but I guess those saved pennies help their space program or something. Everything you need to get started is there with that minimalist Amazon appeal though. I was unpackaged, plugged in, and powered on in minutes.Set up was a breeze after waiting for an update to download and install. If you\\'re familiar with any of the Fire TV Sticks or other Amazon devices, everything here is familiar. I\\'m neck deep in the Amazon environment from Recast to Fire Sticks so this was an easy choice to take a flyer on. And yes, Recast works on this TV. So to the dozens of us that use it, worry not. The new Fire remote is handy and adds the extra stuff you need for full control of a TV while still being simple. Settings, channel up and down, Live TV, etc. are all there. I\\'m not the biggest fan of branded app buttons at the bottom of the remote as things go away and get renamed, but the more buttons the merrier. I\\'m sure they can be rebound to other apps.The introductory price of the 50\" was too good to pass up. But I will say all the regular prices are just high enough to not be complete bargains. I imagine modest discounts will come occasionally and will be well worth considering. And to be fair, these aren\\'t bare minimum or cheap TVs. You get some real bang for your buck. Above average picture quality and honestly the best \"smart\" integration I\\'ve seen in a TV. I know they added one \"premium\" feature of Dolby Vision to the two largest options of the OMNI series but I do wish they would\\'ve made a model with a few more bells and whistles. Especially ones geared towards \"gamers\" and their consoles. 120hz, VRR, stuff like that. Would\\'ve been a riskier business choice I suppose. I was shopping for a bedroom and 65\" or 75\" was just too big and DV wasn\\'t enough of an allure. But for an introductory line of TVs I think they struck the right balance of options in the two lines and prices points. I\\'m not a hands free voice user, so I didn\\'t mind choosing the more budget friendly 4-Series line. And again, the introductory price on the 50\" was a great deal. Borderline steal.

       "  '\\nI got one of these at Prime Day pricing of 200 bucks and I was so pleased with the impressive quality - especially at that price point - that I ordered a second one! I had recently moved into a new apartment and didn\\'t have any television (I\\'d gifted my old one to my kid and grandkids before I left). Now I have a 43\" Fire TV 4 series in both my living room (primarily for video games) and in my bedroom (for lounging and catchin\\' up on my stories). I am extremely happy with the purchases. I mean, for $400, I have two excellent tv\\'s for under the price of one comparable competitor product! Hard to beat that kind of deal.Pro tip: if you go to watch your favorite modern program or film and you get the \"soap opera effect\", where everything looks to real, like you\\'re standing in the studio or it was filmed by the BBC...there is an easy fix! On your remote, hit the settings button (gear icon). Scroll down to Picture. Scroll down to Advanced Settings. Scroll down to Natural Cinema - turn that on. Option B: right under that setting, you can adjust the severity of the \"Motion Smoothing\". Some stuff looks doper with some smoothing! Try level 7, for instance.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI’ll start off by saying this has been a good TV and I like most of the features - the picture is pretty clear, the integration with the remote is seamless, and the navigation has been intuitive. If all of your needs are met with the description above, or you don’t care about principle, I’d recommend this TV.With that being said, I’m tired of companies withholding popular apps that many people enjoy because it competes with one of their own (and in this case, inferior) products.Like many people, I love that nearly every smart TV has music streaming service functionality through downloadable apps. It’s in large part why I decided to purchase a smart TV.Amazon Music just doesn’t hold a candle to Spotify, and I was incredibly disappointed to discover that a TV with so many positive reviews was really just an Amazon marketplace with some popular third party streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) built in. Companies seem to have this chokehold on their own products that they promote at the expense of fan-favorite applications. It doesn’t prompt me to make an Amazon Music account - it just makes for a poor customer experience.I mean - Pandora is available! So where are the other music streaming services?Amazon, listen to your customer base and PLEASE add Spotify to your list of available apps for download. Although this seems unlikely, I’m hopeful that the app is just in development and we will see an update soon.\\n',\n",

The choice is ultimately yours but I’m just trying to help with this review after spending a lot of time trying to find what I thought was the TV right for me.I unpacked my TV. and setup the legs but kept all the plastic “protective” film on it and turned it on. All was well when suddenly the screen went black while it was on the idle screen awaiting for me to find my wifi password. I wasn’t even able to get through the setup process (language choice and wifi network options) before the screen glitched and left it black. I have tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, different batteries in the remote, etc. The light on the bottom turns on when plugged in but does not respond to the remote now. Condition looks great aesthetically, no damage to the box it was shipped in, etc.Even if you did buy one and it worked, I cannot feel confident that a good working condition version of this TV would even last that long if this one is malfunctioning the way it is already.I am just trying to save someone like me the time it takes to return something like this. I’ll be dropping it off for a return tomorrow.P.S. My video is awful but shows the tv plugged in and the attempt to turn it on after it’s malfunction. Buy it if you’d like, the price point is there, but just know the quality is not. Happy holidays!\\n',\n",

They did not use standard machine screw threading for the wall mount, no one at Amazon knows what the proper screw for the TV is, and they did not include them with TV because someone at Amazon has a walnut for a brain. As mentioned in other reviews, the picture is garbage and the sound might as well be non-existent. This is basically a TV designed to sell you more crap from Amazon at the cheapest possible price point. It is a Chinese manufactured piece of garbage loaded with adware. You can get a Hisense from Walmart for about the same price, still have a Chinese piece of junk, and at least it won't data harvest and fill up a third of the display with ads.

By me having a prime and Fire Stick account, set up was automated.  The automation worked flawlessly in my case.  That alone amazed and impressed me.  I added a Samsung Sound Bar to the Fire TV and now this a great entertainment area.  Colors are beautiful on this set, like I said earlier I didn't make but a few minor adjustments to this set.The Fire Stick works flawlessly and it is a lot smoother than the 4k separate Fire Sticks.  The built in Fire Stick integrated perfectly to my Arlo Security System and do not let me forget about Alexa she is working amazingly well with the built in Fire Stick on the Fire TV.I really would purchase another Amazon brand Fire TV with the built in Fire Stick again at this point.  I only had the Fire TV since October 2021.  By being a Prime member for many years now, Amazon offer prime member early deals before the TV were release forsale to the public.  The deal that were offer were a great saving for prime members.I just hope that the Fire TV last many years as my Sony and Samsung have.  Those sets were and still is trouble free.

The biggest issue I see from people are the complaints about the annoying LED light on the front of the TV that always stays on.  Here's a tip:  Just cover it up with either dimming tape or sit something in front of it.  I sat a small DVD player (remember those?) in front of the TV and pushed it up against the TV so that the light is completely blocked.  All functions of the remote still work except in order to shut the TV off, you just have to hold down the blue Alexa button and tell Alexa to shut the TV off.  You can press the same blue Alexa button and it automatically turns it back on.  You really don't even need the power button on the remote.

       "  \"\\nSo far I have had this TV for about four days, ordered it on Prime Day and received it about the next Friday after and I got this delivered to me during the early morning hours. Usually Amazon Prime delivers during the afternoon around my area so when I got a notification that morning that it was already delivered at six am surprised me as I found it sitting in front of the doorstep. So it was delivered early as it was suppose to be delivered on Saturday but I got it a day earlier. Overall, setting this up was pretty simple, I booted it up and apparently it needed to update right out of the box so I let it update which took about an hour but shortly after that getting all the apps that I use onto the TV was pretty simple as well. The picture quality on the TV is pretty good, I think a soundbar isn't really needed as the sound the TV provides is pretty good as well.I have a PS5 and so gaming on this TV is pretty cool. It even switches to a gaming type mode of picture quality when you switch to the HDMI that has your PS5 Connected to which is unique because on my PlayStation 5 when I used on that TV it didn't do that at all and I would have to manually do it from the TV but with the Amazon Fire TV I didn't have to configure anything at all as it switched to that kind of pictured mode. My only problem, which it can be the TV itself or the HDMI Cable I have connected to the Cable Box is that at times it would flicker for a second and then stop, but do it again after awhile. When I'm always gaming, this is never an issue though so it could just be the HDMI Cable that could use a replacement. Overall, I am pretty much glad I got this at such an amazing price and maybe I'll use this TV for a good while.\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nI’ve been putting off getting a tv for my bedroom. Prime day came, I scored!  I have looked at every friggin tv out there and always put the iPad down and backed away. When buzz started about a $99 tv for prime day I was ready. I found the tv on pre sale and started watching the deal. When it went live at 8:00 am day two of prime day……I was headed to an appointment!!  I pulled over, clicked this baby into the cart, and in 6 minutes, the deal was claimed, but I got mine!  The whole idea of having a tv shipped was making me a bit crazy. I mean, cmon, we’ve all seen some pretty haggard boxes showing up on our door steps that went thru the shipping process. This box arrived as if they had just picked it off the tv assembly line and dropped it on my porch. Perfection!  Next, unboxing, assembly and setup.  Easy, easy and easy!  Opened box, attach legs, place in room, plug in!  This 4K tv has a great picture. Menu looks exactly like the fire stick I’m running on the den tv, and, it has pretty decent sound with no sound bar attached. Perfect for the bedroom. Even at regular price, it’s a great deal. But when you apply a $10.00 gift card, and $5 bucks of credit card points…….Best $84 bucks I’ve spent in quite awhile. Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWe hunted for a tv for months, but didn\\'t want a smart tv.  Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43\" was the perfect size for our room).We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, \"no, no, okay.\" Manual only; we didn\\'t want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don\\'t know why anyone complained it couldn\\'t go loud enough.  The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of \"action/motion smoothness\" but didn\\'t really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the  box.A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy!  Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy.  Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected.  When  you figure in the price, it\\'s really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn\\'t even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound.  1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven\\'t tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven\\'t tried it.) We\\'re really happyas is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThis is a review of the Amazon Fire TV 55\" 4-Series 4K UHD Smart TV. I\\'ve never owned an expensive TV so I could not give such a comparison. And I\\'m a 2-decade-long cord-cutter, BTW! This unit was bought to replace a (non-smart) Sceptre 50\" 1080p bought in 2014 w/a gazillion hours of use; it had a center stand that swiveled. Nowadays these all come with wide spread legs, which is fine, except that it went over my bedroom table, so I bought the stand (B078MBL6KM).Compared to my former TV this has a clearer and sharper picture, and the audio is a big improvement; this has as bit of bass to it. The TV is lightweight; the connections easy to access. But this is not a typical TV where you turn it on and a live channel appears. This is a media computer with a big screen; I like it! I still have a Fire TV Box (2015); this is much better, but functions the same as the Fire TV Box & Stick.I plug in a USB with MP4 files on it, and it plays them under the Media Input, just like if you used a Media PC, which I have connected below it, to Input HDMI-1, but I may not need to use it anymore. With my Fire Tablet on the night stand next to a smartphone, my shopping and quick search needs are met therein.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nMounting it was extremely easy (although I had my dad do it but he’s got all the carpenter’s tools; a stud finder, power drill and socket wrench set will do that). It’s very light for such a large TV but still pretty sturdy and well designed. It has more HDMI ports than most newer TVs out there, big bonus, as well as optical, USB and Ethernet ports.As far as interface, super easy. I used Roku previously and this was not a huge leap. It connected to my Amazon account automatically and I had my three other streaming accounts hooked up in minutes. But it walks you though the usual setup the first time you power it on: language, all first time updates, a choice of apps or TV channel searching (can be skipped then added later) and then goes directly to the Home Screen where you can add what you like. Very simple and easy to understand. It doesn’t take forever to load when switching apps; it almost instantly just takes you to where you left off when switching between them. Absolutely love that feature. It does power down when idling on still screens too long but waking and resuming is quick too. The picture and audio settings are a breeze to tweak through the remote. The sound and picture are just right as well; the sound is crisp and balanced and the picture has easy defaults or can be customized. I always turn down the backlight because they always tend to be brighter than i like but it was simple to find. Switching to inputs or new apps is one-button; you don’t have to keep backing out to get to another quickly.Honestly very impressed. I don’t need a lot of bells and whistles so I like when the things I do need a TV for are simple and seamless. It’s super easy switching between TV and three gaming consoles. Easy to add a HTML splitter and take advantage of more devices on one input if needed.I’m the first person I know to get a Fire TV so it was a gamble, but it definitely paid off. Very worthwhile to get a mount if you feel confident installing it (you can always pay for installation if not). It’s a great TV to take advantage of newer game consoles. Personally, the Omni series had a bunch of stuff I didn’t need, so if you just need a TV for streaming and gaming, the 4-Series doesn’t disappoint.On a side note, I saw some reviews about a ‘bright blue standby light’ that no longer exists as of this review. It’s a softer whitish light and not very bright. If a standby light does bother you at night, invest in black electrical tape. I’m not sure why people drop so many stars over minor personal issues. If you do happen to have pet peeves about electronics, it’s always best to research before you buy! And yes, companies do read reviews and see customer suggestions so nitpick away to improve their products. Either way, I have no complaints on what I ended up with.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThis TV from other reviews states this is TCL tv so basically I didn't have much experience with another tv has this is my first tv.So for $400 while being in the Amazon ecosystem this tv works for what I need it to do, work. Once the tv is power on the Tv automatically connected with my internet (I got a Echo Show7 and Fire10) and setup was easy from there. Play on Nintendo Switch and image quality good. Is it the best? No but for my price I take good quality view then no view. If you wanted a tv for $500 under this is it if you're on Amazon already otherwise just go to TCL and save $70 for this tv.Want better image look elsewhere. And pay more than $500+ for a 43 inch.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThis TV is a gem, for the cheap price that it was being offered at the time (under 300$) to get such a beautiful quality like 4K on a star-struck panel really genuinely made this purchase worth it. The ports work fine and there’s quite a bit of them, the picture quality and sound is loud and bursting with top notch quality and honestly I couldn’t be happier with my purchase, seriously, one of the best purchases and upgrades I could've made to my room. Cant forget the elephant in the room which is alexa and compatibility, the remotes alexa is nice but, it pairs fairly well with the echo dot (I have one) They truly go hand in hand making for a nearly hands free experience (if you want hands-free, check out the slightly more expensive Omni variant of this TV)There is...one thing however. My TV picture? Yeah, it wobbles.I thought it was normal or part of my shows, I’d be watching The Boys (not a sponsor, just coincidentally watching an Amazon show on an Amazon TV lmao) and I notice that, fairly rarely, the background will shake for one or two seconds. Now honestly, do I care? No, because it’s so rare and quick that I don’t notice, but I wanted to point it out because that’s what proper reviews do. So I couldn’t quite find how to fix it but hopefully I can find a fix for it somewhere down the line.Other than that, the TV is absolutely worth it, the amazing quality, banging sound, alexa compatibility, and more make this a great choice!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nTwo days in and biggest problem was modifying 38\" wide TV cabinet to fit 55\" TV. Since TV is only 3.5\" wide this just needed a C-notch. 25 lb TV is much easier to manometer than 85 lb in guest bedroom. Mounted on slides so easy to get to rear panel.RCA 5 digit remote (has numeric keypad, can control 3 devices) code was 12434, same as many, many other smart TVs. 4-digit (Philips) 2851.Should pay for self in about 4 months since now streaming & OTA (102 channels) ( dash on remote does not work but TV understands whole numbers).Not the greatest status symbol but also \"value priced\". White box on top is for Bose system so TV sound is unimportant.Was hand delivered to my door by careful driver who called first. Only question now is longevity but makes captions easier to read than previous 43\" TV..ps I do not find the blue light on the bottom objectionable. If I did, a small piece of electrical tape should block.Update: since I receive over 100 OTA channels, I need a numeric keypad. The problem I found is that the Fire TV apparently has a two stage turn off. The first only lasts for about five minutes, then \"changes\" and needs a different signal.. The codes above cannot turn the TV back on once it reaches the second stage.The RCA cannot handle this but the three device Philips SRP3219G/27  remote allows multiple codes. 2851 can handle everything except the second stage turn on. Codes 1091 or 6091 can provide the turn on but not much else so I programmed the \"TV\" button to 2851 and the \"STR\" for 1091. That works for me.pps the lighter color Philips remotes are easier to see the buttons.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe TV is really nice, looks great and integrates with Roku speakers.But my primary usecase is using Xfinity cable service.  The default when powered on is Amazon.I would prefer it to remember the last HDMI selection and start with that.  As it is now, I have to use two remotes... The Fire remote to change SOURCE (Which is in settings and not on a button); then use the Xfinity remote to do other things.  I get it... This is an attempt to move everyone over to Amazon by default, but I can't do that just now.  It would be nice if it remembered the HDMI selection between power cycles.I have not tried controlling it with voice via Alexa.  Perhaps I can tell her to change to HDMI1?  That would be better, but still not as nice as remembering the selection.Update (07/06/22):  The voice control on the remote WILL change the HDMI Source.  That makes changing source much easier. Also, Depending on how you turn it on (from the included Fire Remote or a paired Xfinity remote) it will change source to the the last setting.  If I turned it off with the XFinity remote, then use it to turn it back on... It will come on to the Fire home page, but a few moments later, change the the previous HDMI (and sound) settings.  I'm upping my rating to 5 Star.I was really enjoying the 4K resolution, and noting that the picture is really goodAlso, works with my Roku soundbar.  That makes two streaming options and cable as my sources.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI was a bit concerned when I purchased this TV. I wasn’t sure about the quality. But, my top of the line flat screen that I had for 18 years died. I needed a TV and knew I wanted a smart TV. This was on sale. It had all the features I wanted. I would have like to have purchased a bigger size, but with bigger sizes comes bigger prices. I bought the 55”. My 15 year old grandson helped me set everything up. It’s been easy enough to use. I’m very happy with the TV and would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a new TV. It arrived in 2 days. I’m a prime member, so it was free shipping. It arrived in a big Amazon truck; I have never seen a truck delivering that big before. Two men brought it carefully to my door. We had it set up and ready to go in 5 minutes! So far, I’m loving it!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI have used the Fire sticks for a few years on smaller TV's with no problem and now I wanted a bigger TV so I decided to stick with the Fire, but I didn't know that Amazon had it's own tv brand, I thought I would give it a try since I had no problems with other Amazon brand stuff. Just as with Fire stick set up is easy. Picture is great, I had to play around with the sound settings, but I got it worked out to my personal preferences. I had price compared a bit and feel like the price was very good, I might could have got a 55 inch TV for a bit cheaper but I felt comfortable buying the Amazon brand knowing that if I had a problem they would be there to help me, returns and such. Had it about a month now, no problems, I enjoy it very much and spent less than $400 on a 55 inch TV, so 5 stars\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nAmazon's FireTV is such an easy Smart TV to use, for both cable households and cable cutters. The apps work so seemlessly  with the TV, which makes streaming a much easier process. If you don't have cable, your broadcast antenna works so efficiently with the TV, you won't miss having cable. The TV reads the broadcast signal and gives you a channel guide that is nearly perfect. The Alexa integration is simple and the voice button on the remote makes it easy to change to any TV channel or app. You'll love this TV!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nShipped fast and arrived on my doorstep In great shape!  Thin and light!  Easy to setup and use. Dedicated remote buttons for my top 4 streaming apps.

It seems Amazon has dialed back the advertising and I don’t feel like I’m being upsold every time I watch a show.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI think I really like this TV especially since my local CBS affiliate's owner and Dish Network have removed CBS for over 2 months in a carriage dispute.  I can now get my local CBS through my Paramount+ subscription which is awesome.  The TV was easy to set up after all the updating and downloading.  For the money this is a good deal.  The downside?  We got this TV for our bedroom and when it is off there is this really annoying bright standby light on the TV.  Otherwise, I would probably give this review 5 stars.  I will be putting a piece of black tape over the light which is kind of a sad thing to do on a new purchase.\\n\",\n",

We just figured this out and it seems much better... Time will tell and if it ends up not being the resolution to our issue, I'll update this!\\n\",\n",

It had so much more than I had imagined built into the TV. Besides everything that you might expect, be prepared, it has so much more.They offer you apps at no extra charge. Good ones! Sure, they have the premium ones that you pay for, if you want them but the selection of free apps is incredibleThe remote is child’s play. Even I didn’t have a hard time with it! The picture quality… Unsurpassed. I can’t complain about anything (except that maybe it’s hard to tear myself away from the set now! Lol)You truly can’t go wrong with this TV.Oh, and I was blown over by the price as well. I even asked the informed techs in my family…what is wrong with this and their answer was that with Amazons return policy, I couldn’t go wrong with talking the leap. They were right. Great purchase.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUpdated review***As promised I received my replacement tv 2 days later. Delivery was GREAT the 2nd time around of course the service wasn’t through UPS this time. I set my tv up which didn’t take long at all. Very simple I actually never even looked at the instructions manual for reference. Picture was nice and clear. Sound was ok. I typically have Soundbars connected to all my TVs so I’m used to it sounding a bit more higher quality. Absolutely recommend purchasing this tv especially at the $99 price I paid. My only issue would be who they setup delivery with. If it’s through UPS just prepare yourself to return itWell let’s start by saying I knew something was going to go wrong. When I purchase delicate items I prefer FedEx to deliver. When I noticed that it was being shipped through UPS I automatically assumed it would arrive shattered. To my surprise the screen was intact. BUT…yes there’s always a but. When I plugged the tv in I immediately noticed the screen was completely black with lines going through it. Almost looked as if there was water damage. I called Amazon and spoke to an agent who was very apologetic and arranged to have UPS come pick up the tv. He also shipped out a replacement tv. Hopefully the next review I write is solely about the tv itself.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, \"how much did you pay for this again?\" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don\\'t understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations.  So glad I got it!\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nI took advantage of prime day and bought the 55\" version of this TV.  I was replacing a 37\" on the wall.  The installation was easy, and when first starting up (I associated it with my amazon account when purchasing) it auto-updated a couple of times and kept restarting to do it, but after about 15 minutes was up and ready to go.  I played with some of the built in apps and guide and they are pretty cool and work well.  I tried airplay from both my iphone and Mac and it works great -- just like an apple TV.  I use Tivo, and to get the Tivo remote to work with this TV, I had to use \"Element\" as the brand (so to those reviews where they said the TV is not in the list of other products, use \"Element.\"  One review complained that the TV always started on the homescreen when turned on, and not the video input they want (HDMI1)  You can set it the way you want, but you have to go into settings, picture, power-on options and you can choose home or use last video input used.  This way it stays on the cable box etc.  The Alexa feature is cool and works, but I really don\\'t use it.  One of the reviews complained about not using standard screw sizes for wall mount.. This is not valid.. I ran into a similar issue as I was going from a 37\" to a 55\" and the screw sizes for these size sets are different where one uses M4 vs M6 screws...  Any wall mount kit will have the correct size screws included with it, and even if you are replacing an older smaller set like me and have lost the rest of the screws, I went to home depot and they sell them there as M6 in various lengths...  TV has only been installed and working 24 hours, but so far well worth the money!\\n',\n",

The TV TCL brand recognized my wifi immediately during boot up and I didn't even have to put in a password...same with it registering my Amazon...it already knew me....weird...I didn't have to put in an email or password...just a pin for parental setup.  The fire app software on the TV or Smart TV feature is pretty nice and easy to use...and surprisingly fast...ish..only a true gamer would notice any lag.  The remote has quick buttons to Hulu Amazon Prime Video and Disney, very nice and looks like a longer flatter roku remote...not bad.  The backside has 3 hdmi ports and an ethernet port and some other stuff.  If front facing the TV those ports are on the right and the power is by itself on the left.  For my basement...the normal person is about 15 ft away...this TV is perfect for this distance.  To get to other inputs...hit settings button on remote and on the screen you will see inputs.

As far as picture quality for the price it’s pretty good. HDR10 looks amazing and very clear and I found it to be more than bright enough. Yes You can find better TVs with brighter HDR and Dolby Vision but you will pay twice as much. I have 4 other TVs with Dolby vision and the difference isn’t a deal breaker for me.If you need a replacement TV and can live without Dolby Vision you will not be disappointed with this one. HDR and HLG is more than enough for this TV.5 Star recommendation\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe picture is incredibly clear and the color is excellent. The remote control is simple to understand and use. This tv was so easy to set up and program all the Apps, that my wife and watch.That I didn’t have to look up anything in the owners manual. It took me less than a half hour program all the Apps. Most of this time was waiting for the App.to install. If you have Amazon Prime? The TV programs itself using your current Amazon Prime Account. So far I’m 100% satisfied.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nReally solid television for the price. I got the 50\" for $320 and it\\'s really an impressive value proposition. I\\'ve got a Samsung Q70 in the living room and a Vizio M Quantum in my bedroom and this compares favorably to both of those considerably more pricey TV\\'s. Smart features are well organized and easily accessible, voice integration with Alexa devices works well, display quality is about an 7-8/10 and more than adequate for all but the most picky viewers. Biggest negative is the sound, which is tinny and underwhelming. I generally hook up TV\\'s to sound bars so I don\\'t put much value on built-in speakers but, being in a guest room, this one isn\\'t getting a sound bar setup and it\\'s noticeable just how hollow the sound is compared to even a cheap sound bar. One notable plus on this TV is it\\'s extremely lightweight; I didn\\'t put it on a scale but it weighed probably half of what the older 42\" TV it replaced did.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nSo far I'm am enjoying everything about this TV!! The 4K UHD is very nice, I would say it's competitive against other makers that offer 4K UHD but at a much more affordable price in my opinion. The sound settings are also a nice touch with different EQs available to pick. I will say you need to tweak the display imaging settings to get the true 4K out of it but it the end I'm loving my new TV!\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nSo far this TV has been well worth the money.  I've only had it for about two weeks at present, but it's been working perfectly.  Plenty of HDMI inputs, and the USB port is great for a 4TB HDD on which I have a bunch of TV shows and movies in mp4 format.  The WiFi connection is strong and adding any apps I needed/wanted was a cinch, as was signing into them, which is made much easier by using a computer.The picture is great, and streaming in 4k looks fantastic, though 1080p and 720p items look great as well, the latter two of which are the resolutions of the aforementioned movies and TV shows on the HDD, respectively.  I also tried wirelessly casting from both my M1 Mac Mini and my AM02 Windows mini pc, and it worked flawlessly.  It has all of the expected settings to adjust the picture and sound.The sound, while not great, is adequate, though I wouldn't expect sound from little speakers to be spectacular anyway.  It would be easy to add better sound via speakers connected to the optical port, but for now the built in sound is good enough.My only real complaint thus far is with the built in Media Player.  I have my movies and TV shows sorted by folders and subfolders on the HDD, and the media player shows every folder on the disk in one big group.  In my case that's over 1000 folders.  I can sort them alphabetically, but if I want to watch something near the end of the alphabet, such as 'V for Vendetta', I have to scroll through 1000+ folders to get to it, which takes upwards of five minutes or more, and is tedious and extremely annoying.  Luckily, I found MX Player, which is an app available for the TV that sorts the folders as intended, such as clicking into the 'Films' folder, then the 'V' folder, then the title folder, then clicking the mp4 to play it.  MX Player also has a lot of useful settings adjustments for playback.  Either Amazon should revamp their Media Player app or include an already installed alternative like MX Player.All in all this has been a great TV so far.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive 4k TV.  No, it's not a $1000 TV with all the bells and whistles and the best of everything, but for the price it's a great choice.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nWe've had this TV for a little over 2 weeks now and it's not the worst. I really like that the features from the firestick is just automatically on the TV. It's really nice not having to mess with the firestick separately. I love that it's one remote that i didn't have to sync to the tv and the stick. The picture is really clear and the TV is fairly slim, it mounted easily to our wall mount. Our old TV stopped turning on and we ordered this one because, a) the price was hard to beat for a 55 inch tv and b) we were able to make Amazon's monthly payments instead. We weren't expecting to need a new TV and honestly didn't have the money saved so being able to use the payments option was crucial. Also yes I know we could of waited til we had the money saved but after a crap day at work its nice to be able to unwind with a favorite movie or a fun video game, don't judge me to hard. If you've been thinking about trying one of these TV's out I do reccomend them so far.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nI was replacing an older TV that had issues staying connected to the internet. I ordered a smaller Fire TV last year for a guest bedroom and it worked great, so I thought I would order another one.  With the price and the reviews, I was skeptical, but I figured it couldn't be worse than my current TV.  I ordered with Prime.  It came a day early. It was so easy to set up!!  Unpackage, plug in, turn on.  The scary part is that it connected with a nearby fire stick, so when I turned it on, it displayed my name.  I didn't even have to connect it to my wifi.  The remote feels a little flimsy, but works fine.  The picture quality is better than anticipated. No high HD but very clear.  Sound average and decent.  Lastly, as to not have to buy a new TV stand, I had to buy a single platform stand. The legs were wide (i think 3ft apart)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nSo far so good! Set up was very easy, Great picture, great sound. Excellent value for the money.. I’m very happy with this purchase!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI have to be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I bought this TV. Meaning, I wasn't expecting a great picture, or great sound, or user interface.Boy was I shocked when I set it up! First of all, set-up is a breeze, especially when it's linked to your Amazon account.Next, when I was done setting it up, and was able to watch TV, I was totally impressed! The picture quality is amazing! It almost looks like your watching a live telecast. If you're watching a SD channel, it looks like it's upconverted to either 1080p or 4K. Like I said, I was completely surprised and impressed.The user interface is very easy to understand and navigate.Simply put, this is an excellent 4k tv and I highly recommend it!!!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI was kinda scared to buy this TV at first cause of some of the other reviews. Especially with it being shipped. I didn’t want to receive it broken. The TV was in perfect shape, no problems. Set up was easy. The layout of the TV is easy to operate. I like this TV more than my Vizio. I wish the remote had numbers on it, it has the channel up and down buttons.I did buy a roku for it only cause I have spectrum for TV service and this TV doesn’t have the app to download yet. I also bought an antenna to get local channels.The picture quality is perfect A+++I do recommend this TV to anyone who wants to save money, and wants an easy set up.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe camera for our ring doorbell didn’t pop up on it even with the setting for that being turned off my son would be much happier. I even went to deregister it from my account and it said “are you sure, by deregistering this item it will make a lot of features on it unusable. Other then that issue everything works fine, but in all honesty I think it’s going back cuz of the Alexa features not being able to be turned off. It gives you the option but it still announces  and stops your program you’re watching or game you’re playing to announce any movement from a person standing on your porch or a bird flying by. So yea it’s probably going back and we’ll get him a tv from Walmart or someplace else.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nNot that I know a lot about today's technology, but I found this tv to be everything I need. Also bought an Amazon smart plug so I can have Alexa turn the livingroom light on and off with my remote. See? Even old people can learn new things.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nUnfortunately my Multiple sclerosis has gotten bad. I’m not used to sitting around but sometimes you have to listen to your body.This TV is the perfect size for my bedroom in my Mom’s house. (Thx Mom)My sister helped me get it all set up (thx sis).Having spent 20yrs flipping houses, thankfully there are a lot of those keeps of shows to amuse me.The TV’s picture is really clear and I’ve never had a TV this big. I feel like I’m in a movie theater.Thank you Amazon for putting this on sale!! Never thought I would spend money on a massive television but then I never thought I’d spend my 60’s sitting on my behind.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI am so pleased with not only the television, but the Fire TV platform. I've used a Fire Stick in the past, but this television takes it to the next level.  It's easy to operate, I have a great selection of things to watch - even before paying for any streaming services. I dumped my cable and am saving $120 a month now and I can even get local news channels in the interface!! Great tv - great performance.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI bought the TV during a special being ran as 1: An upgrade and 2: To replace a TV that broke.  First, I like that I can make payments with opening a credit card or entering one of those interesting financing schemes that everyone wants to introduce.  As for the TV itself, the picture quality is fine, and it was very easy to set up.  Just connect it to the internet and it will handle the rest.  For those concerned about Alexa, it is off by default.  As this is my only Alexa device, I won’t be using it.  Most popular streaming services are available on the TV.  If you have a Fire Stick, this is not much different.  As for gaming, I have a PS3 and PS4 connected (there are four HDMI 2.0 port with one being eArc) and the quality has been good for me.  I have not experienced any lag on the screen.  The display is 60Hz.  Some of the text may have a slight blur on the edges but not enough to cause issues in my opinion.  I only noticed it when the console was updating.  The remote is simple and it is Bluetooth, which I also paired a set of headphones for listening (I live in an apartment). So far, this is a great TV.Downsides?  The Fire TV app on iPhone, unless I haven’t found a way yet, does not allow to add apps to the TV from anywhere like Roku.  My biggest gripe has nothing to do with the TV but how it was delivered.  Amazon sent this package through USPS, which Amazon notified me that my package was left in the mailbox (yeah, ok. Lol).  USPS said that the package could not be left because no one was home and there was no secure place to leave it. I assumed I would have to make a trip to the post office.  Apparently, someone thought leaving a 55 inch television right next to the entrance door of an apartment building was a great idea.  No way anyone was going to steal it.  I’m glad no one stole it and it wasn’t damaged.  I’m still tinkering around with it and will update.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI am IN LOVE with this TV! I bought this to replace my old Roku TV and it is a million times better! As soon as I plugged this in and turned it on it connected to my Alexa and signed me into my Amazon account. It is super fast, the picture is a 10/10, and it has voice controls which I love. Super easy to navigate different apps. I'm thinking about buying another one that is larger just to replace the Phillips TV I have in my living room because I love it so much.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe tv was a last minute replacement to a 50in tv for our bedroom. We accidentally cracked the screen while moving it. The Amazon 55” came within 24 hours and we had it up by the evening. The mounting holes on the back of the tv are definitely a little awkward and requires a mount that has some flexibility for installation.As for picture quality the blacks aren’t the blackest but it’ll do for a bedroom tv. It looks good and works well. Idk if I’d use this tv for a home theater like experience. You’d probably be better off going for something of a better quality and more money.I like being able to ask my Amazon echo to turn if off if I leave the the room. I didn’t have to do any kind of set up to get that feature to work.So far so good.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI like the large clear picture. The slim depth of the tv. The handy 1 remote for all my viewing including Netflix and Hulu. I’m in Arizona so the LED lighting keeps my room 10 degrees cooler. That makes a huge difference! It’s a wonderful purchase.\\n',\n",

Love this so much I told my friend, she ordered the same tv and doorbell camera from Amazon. Love, Love this.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\ni love this TV and will never get another TV that isn't a fire TV again. I love that you can ask alexa and bring up the shows you want to watch so you don't have to search for anything. I did have a little trouble with setup. It got stuck on a update loop but if you unplug the TV and hold the power button for a few seconds after you plug back in it works fine and i have not had an issue with it since. this was an amazing purchase and i got it on prime deal days so i only paid 100$ for it. next prime days i will be stalking the site to see if i can pick up another one for my room but even paying full price, i think this TV would be worth it.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nLet me tell you, I love this TV!! I spent HOURS researching, reading reviews and debating between what kind of TV to get. Ultimately, I loved the reviews and specs on this TV and purchased it. You will not be disappointed. The clarity of the TV is fabulous. The ease of setting it up (putting together and getting apps loaded on it) was a pleasant surprise. We mounted it on the wall and couldn't be happier. I love being able to stream any app I want and my Amazon account it integrated, making it a breeze for prime movies/tv. We have a brand new Vizio and I like my Fire TV better, so that says something!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nBought this on a wim for a good deal 55\" under $300 around the holidays. Wouldn\\'t buy again, wouldn\\'t suggest buying. The smart and alexa features are extremely intrusive, no way to disable them. Had to block the MAC address from my WiFi because of the TV trying to reconnect...Additionally the volume controls just randomly stop working constantly requiring a restart  of the tv. Other than that, the video quality is pretty great.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAmazon fire is better than my former Roku as a streaming interface. The system is not smart enough to know that you have a subscription to Discovery + and starts you on a trial.The sound is good enough that we no longer need a soundbar.The screen is reflective of windows and light sources to the point that we looked at buying blinds. The problem is worse as the viewing angle increases.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI bought this during Amazon\\'s recent Lightening Deal, couldn\\'t resist!  Got it today and easily set it up (although I wish I didn\\'t have to install all the apps and sign in again with password, it would be cool if it could just grab that info from my other Fire Stick setups).  Once everything was set up, it is easy to use.  Big plus is it is easy to switch between my Directv input and the Amazon Fire TV.  I just have to say \"HDMIx\" into the microphone to switch, or just wait 30 seconds and it will switch automatically.  I will update this if there are any problems down the road, but so far so good!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThis could have been a great TV, but I'll never know because right out of the box it refused to connect to my home Wi-Fi. I literally tried fixing the issue for DAYS but to no avail. Assuming I must have received a defective TV, I ordered a replacement. But no, it wasn't a fluke. The SAME issue happened with the second one. So while the TV technically worked, I was never able to get beyond initial setup due to its inability to connect to Wi-Fi.It also seems impossible to use a soundbar with it. I tried TWO different soundbars of different brands. I connected one using an optical cable, then tried a second using HDMI ARC. On both occasions the TV insisted on playing back sound from its own speakers in addition to the sound coming from the soundbar. This is DESPITE my having turned off the TV speakers from the settings menu. And then double and triple checking just to be sure. The settings absolutely confirm the speakers are off, and yet they are not. So it creates this double audio overlap that is out of sync and unfixable. And intolerable.In my complete frustration I decided to just go ahead and spend an extra $200 on a Sony TV. My mental health was worth the investment. And what do you know? The Sony connected IMMEDIATELY to my wifi. It didn't even hesitate. It also had no issues at all with my soundbar. I didn't even have to go into the settings just to make it work. Just plug and play. Not hope and pray.There's no excuse for why I had these issues on TWO of these TVs. I don't care how cheap or expensive something is, I at least expect it to perform as promised. Instead what I received was a nightmare packaged up in a TV-shaped box where it was ready to take my soul and every ounce of patience I had. It's a shame. Because I had high hopes for this TV, and it seemed to be an amazing value.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nBought this TV during the Prime day live event for $99.00. This was a great investment for the money. The setup was easy. The smart features work well and the picture quality is excellent. There are plenty of inputs for external devices which can be seen in the product details. I have mine connected to an broadcast antenna mounted in the attic and the reception is good. Naturally reception would be different for everyone and dependent on the distance of the TV antenna to the television station broadcast towers. If I ever need another TV I would probably purchase again even at the current price listed on Amazon.\\n'],\n",
